backend bootcamp\nIntroduction\nWelcome!\nThis book is intended to bridge the gap between what you learned in a Web development bootcamp and what it takes to build and operate backends for real-world products.\nYou already know how to build a backend for a Web application: you write some code, you put it in a server somewhere, you configure some database, and you hit 'run'. Simple enough, no? \nBut, when you join a medium-sized project, you'll find that, typically, things are not so simple. We set out to protect ourselves from all kinds of failure scenarios by ensuring our backends don't just work, but are robust.\nFor example, have you ever considered what happens to your backend...\n\n... when you have 10x, 100x, 1000x more requests to your server?\n... when the database disk catches fire?\n... when the datacenter hosting your server has an outage?\n\nTo address these kind of failures, and others more mundane but also more subtle, backends tend to get complicated: lots of middle layers, lots of different tools everywhere, architecture diagrams with lots of boxes and arrows, strange artifacts in the code, intricate procedures to do things that, for simple systems, would be a couple of commands away.\nThis complexity can be overwhelming at first. It's not obvious to understand what's the purpose of everything, how it all fits together, why things are done that particular way, and which are the implications. So that this transition is easier, and you can become a productive, knowledgeable contributor to the team as soon as possible, we'll learn all this from the ground up.\nWe won't teach you about specific technologies. Depending on the team you end up joining, you will find different langugages, databases, deployment systems, all kinds of different buzzwords that will sound alien to you. You can teach yourself those comparatively easily, if needed.\nRather, we'll focus on the commonalities: the building principles for which all those technologies are nothing but implementations. Tools come and go, but principles remain. Plus, tools cannot shield you from those principles: some are fundamental in nature, and permeate every single component of a production-grade Web architecture.\nWe'll go through the theory, and then apply it to a real project.\nRequirements\nBasic knowledge of JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and the command line interface is assumed.\n"},"001-programming-a-backend/":{"url":"001-programming-a-backend/","title":"Programming a backend","keywords":"","body":"Programming a backend\nBackends are fundamentally different to programs that you run in your own computer.

The word backend implies being part of a bigger system that has, at least, a frontend counterpart of some kind.\nFrontends and backends run on different computers. Frontends run on user's devices, such as laptops, mobile phones, or even lightbulbs nowadays.\nFrontends and backends need to talk to each other. Since they run on different computers, they need to do so over a network.\nA system comprised of computers that talk to each other over a network is called a distributed system.\n\nComputers send messages to each other over a medium that loses them\nIf you get nothing else from this bootcamp, let it be this:\n\nComputers send messages to each other over a medium that loses them.\n\nEverything we'll learn in this course is just different ways this fact affects building systems that do their job.\n\nThe medium loses messages\nThe physical link between two computers can break. Someone might trip over the wire. If it's a wireless network, one of them might go into a tunnel. The Internet, composed of millions and millions of links like these, can break in unquantifiable ways.\nA consequence of this is that:\n\nWhen you send a message, you don't know whether it will reach its destination.\n\nBut what if it's important to know that the message reached the other end? After all, you're trying to get computers to collaborate!\nYou might suggest: let's agree with the recipient for them to reply back with another message telling us that they have received the message.\nBut, in exactly the same fashion, since this message goes through the same unreliable medium, it can be lost too! So we reach another necessary consequence:\n\nWhen you don't get the response you're expecting, you have no idea if the recipient received your message in the first place.\n\nA knee-jerk reaction to not getting such a response is to assume that the whole communication failed, that is, that it was your message to the recipient that was lost, not their reply back to you. This assumption doesn't always work! Think about a monetary transaction: if you tell another computer to move some money, and it doesn't reply back, you can't just assume that it didn't move the money.\n\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant C as Client\n  participant S as Server\n\n  C ->>+ S: \"Transfer 100$ to Alice\"\n\n  note left of S: There's some delay processing the request.\n\n  C ->> C: ðŸš¨ Timeout ðŸš¨\n\n  note left of S: Retrying...\n\n  C ->>+ S: \"Transfer 100$ to Alice\"\n\n  S ->>- C: OK\n  S ->>- C: OK\n\n  note over C: (Where's my money?)\n\n\nYour solutions must take these two realities into account in order to work robustly. How? Well, keep reading!\nYou don't know how long it will take a message to reach the other side\nWhen you are a computer and you're expecting a message, you have two choices:\n\nWait indefinitely.\nGive up after some time.\n\nWait indefinitely\nIf you wait indefinitely, the task you're going to do on receiving the message will be delayed indefinitely. This may mean leaving a user waiting, staring at a spinner, until they give up and close your app, this time really forever. If it's not a person who's waiting, but an automatic process of some kind, you might leave that waiting forever.\nThis is rarely the optimal solution.\nGive up after some time\nThis is what we call a timeout.\nIt works like this: you set a timer alongside an operation that you don't know how long will take. In our case, waiting for a message from another computer.\nIf the operation finishes first, then the timer is canceled and everything works. You have successfully coordinated through an ocean of uncertainty, hooray!\n\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant C as Client\n  participant S as Server\n\n  C ->> C: Set timer\n  C ->>+ S: \"Do this\"\n  S ->>- C: OK\n  C ->> C: Cancel timer\n\n\nBut if the timer finishes first, you cancel the operation (this cancellation might take several forms), acknowledge that the communication failed, and handle the situation as best as you can. We'll see how.\n\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant C as Client\n  participant S as Server\n\n  C ->> C: Set timer\n  C ->>+ S: \"Do this\"\n\n  note left of S: The request has some delay\n\n  C ->> C: ðŸš¨ Timeout ðŸš¨\n\n  C ->> C: Mark operation as failed\n\n\n\nCaution: timeouts tell you nothing\nRemember:\n\nWhen you don't get the response you're expecting, you don't know if the recipient received your message in the first place.\n\nTo which we may add:\n\nWhen you haven't received the response you're expecting yet, you don't know whether you will receive it or not in the future.\n\nSo, on a timeout, there are four possibilities. You haven't received the response yet because...\n\n... your message got lost and never reached nor will it ever reach the recipient, so they can't reply back.\n\n\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant F as Server A\n  participant N as Network (abstract)\n  participant B as Server B\n\n  F ->> N: \"Do this\"\n\n  note right of N: (Some routing failure occurs and message is lost.)\n\n  F ->> F: ðŸš¨ Timeout ðŸš¨\n\n\n\n... your message didn't reach its recipient yet, but it might in the future, so it might reply back eventually.\n\n\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant F as Server A\n  participant N as Network (abstract)\n  participant B as Server B\n\n  F ->> N: \"Do this\"\n\n  note right of N: (There's some delay due to network latency.)\n\n  F ->> F: ðŸš¨ Timeout ðŸš¨\n\n  N ->>+ B: \"Do this\"\n  B ->>- N: OK\n  N ->> F: OK\n\n\n\n\n... your message reached the recipient, but the response got lost and you will never receive it.\n\n\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant F as Server A\n  participant N as Network (abstract)\n  participant B as Server B\n\n  F ->> N: \"Do this\"\n  N ->>+ B: \"Do this\"\n\n  note left of N: (Some routing failure occurs and message is lost.)\n\n  B ->>- N: OK\n  F ->> F: ðŸš¨ Timeout ðŸš¨\n\n\n\n... your message reached the recipient; the response hasn't reached you yet, but it might in the future.\n\n\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant F as Server A\n  participant N as Network (abstract)\n  participant B as Server B\n\n  F ->> N: \"Do this\"\n  N ->>+ B: \"Do this\"\n  B ->>- N: OK\n\n  note left of N: (There's some delay due to network latency.)\n\n  F ->> F: ðŸš¨ Timeout ðŸš¨\n  N ->> F: OK\n\n\nA very common pitfall is to assume that, since the communication failed, it never reached and it won't ever reach the recipient and so it won't have any effect. This is only true in scenario 1 out of the four.\nFor example: say your backend calls a database to store something. It expects the database to reply back, either confirming the operation or reporting some kind of error (maybe you didn't have permissions or something). But the call times out instead. In this case, you can't tell whether a later read to the database will retrieve the data you intended to store or not.\nYou should only behave as if you know that the operation has failed (or succeeded) at the other end if doing so is a reasonable assumption for your use case. But you have to plan for the consequences. We'll look more into this.\nAnother, more subtle, pitfall is to assume that, because you have timed out, the message has either reached the recipient (scenarios 3 and 4) or will never reach it (scenario 1). But, in scenario 2, your message could eventually arrive and have an effect at some point in the future! This is especially relevant when retrying the operation; keep reading.\nKeep calm and embrace uncertainty\nLet's start with some good news: most of the time, things just work, especially for simple systems that don't have a lot of load and don't depend on a lot of communication; and, most of the time, a simplistic communication failure handling that just assumes the whole operation failed and aborts gives good enough results.\nThis is because most operations aren't critical and it's safe if the user just retries them if they want.\nFor example, when changing the Twitter bio, it's OK if the user is told \"sorry, the operation failed, try again after a while\" even if it actually succeeded or will eventually succeed. The user will just click \"Save\" again and save the same thing, or, if they don't, maybe they'll just be surprised later if the aborted bio shows up. No big deal.\nBut think about monetary transactions and things get ugly fast!\nIn Cabify, when a journey is finished, the driver sends a \"drop-off\" message to our backend and our backend charges the rider some amount. What if this message times out?\nWe can't just abort the drop-off and leave the journey hanging. Also, we can't just assume that the drop-off reached the backend and it's just that its response got lost or delayed. We just don't know if the operation has succeeded and the rider has been charged or if it has failed and the rider hasn't been charged. So what can we do?\nIt's not enough to just resend the drop-off, like in the simplistic strategy above. If the previous message did get to its recipient, then the rider was charged and when the new drop-off arrives, the rider will be charged again!\nContinued retries + idempotency = guaranteed eventual success\nWhat we're missing is idempotency. Idempotency means that processing the same message any number of times yields the same effects as processing it just once.\nIdempotency allows us to retry communicating any number of times without worry. If you don't get confirmation that a message has succeeded, just retry it! If it didn't succeed previously, maybe it will now. If it did succeed previously, then the new attempt will just be ignored.\n\nBy retrying an idempotent operation until you see it succeed, you know it will be performed exactly once.\n\nThere are different ways to achieve idempotency. The simplest is to keep track on the backend of which messages you have already processed. When you get a message, you first check if you've already processed it. If you have, then you do nothing.\nIn our example, when our backend processes a drop-off, we internally mark the journey as finished. If we receive the drop-off again, we first check that the journey hasn't already finished. If it has, then we just do nothing so the rider won't get charged twice.\nCaution: communication success != operation success\nIt's a common pitfall to mix the operation itself with the communication of the operation.\nIf you ask someone to do something and they respond \"no I won't,\" then the operation failed (you didn't get what you wanted) but the communication succeeded (they heard your request and you heard their response).\nIf you do the same over the phone and as soon as you have finished asking you enter a tunnel and lose connectivity meaning you never hear the response back, then the communication failed and the operation may or may not have succeeded (they may have said \"OK,\" hung up and left).\nYour natural reaction to this situation would be to call back and ask the same thing:\n\nIf they didn't hear you before you entered the tunnel, then they'll either respond \"OK\" or \"no I won't.\" By retrying, you have made sure that the communication has finally succeeded! If you kept accidentally entering tunnels at the worst possible times, then you would just keep calling and eventually you would get the message through, even at the cost of exasperating whoever's on the other side. (In time, we'll see how an exasperated server looks like).\n\nIf they did hear you before, they'll typically respond either \"again, I won't\" or \"I have already performed the operation.\" This is idempotency at play! Only very obtuse people would happily do the same thing again. Idempotency is just common sense to us; sadly, common sense needs to be taught to the machines. This allows us to repeat communications without fear that we will trigger the consequences too many times.\n\n\nThe point is that distinguishing communication failure from operation failure comes naturally to us but not so much to our distributed programs, so we need to be aware of this distinction.\nCommunication failures are typically called transport layer failures. Operation failures are called application layer failures.\nThis mix up is made worse by our programming languages and libraries, which often report both communication failure and operation failure in a single err variable. Letâ€™s look at an example API client request for retrieving an artist from the Spotify API:\nspotify.getArtist('Rosalia')\n  .catch(function onError(err) {\n    console.log(err);\n  });\n\nIn the probable case an error happens, how best to deal with it? One way to deal with these exceptions would be to handle each http status in a different way:\nspotify.getArtist('Rosalia')\n  .catch(function onError(err) {\n    if (err.status === 400) {\n      console.log('Bad request, Rosalia does not exist.');\n    } else if (err.status === 401) {\n      console.log('No valid API key provided.');\n    } else if (err.status === 404) {\n      console.log('The requested resource does not exist.');\n    }\n  });\n\nHowever, this way of handling the error assumes the error comes from an operational issue when the truth can be much more damning. For example, what happens if the error is in fact due to a timeout in the network request? There's no status code in there...\nThis may be the main reason why this is such a common pitfall, combined with the fact that, as we said before in our Twitter bio example, just equating communication failure with operation failure works in many cases.\nGuaranteed eventual success + ordering preservation = guaranteed eventual agreement\nThere's still one potential problem, though.\nImagine you send a message to your backend like \"set Twitter bio to 'I ate cockroaches'\". This times out: it's stuck in the network somewhere, being delayed, so it hasn't made it to the backend. You retry the operation after a while, and now it succeeds.\nNow you realize the bio has a typo and send another message: \"set Twitter bio to 'I hate cockroaches'\". It succeeds.\nBut the first message is still out there, in the network. Say it eventually gets through to the backend. If the backend happily processes it, the bio will now read \"I ate cockroaches\", while you still think it reads \"I hate cockroaches\".\nThis is just one way, a subtle one, that messages can be processed in a different order than they're sent. Systems are rarely designed for it. Many naively assume a series of request-response communications necessarily result in client and server agreeing on the end result. Well, now you know better!\nAnother way out-of-order processing may happen is a very common frontend pitfall: sending concurrent (meaning: overlapping in time) AJAX requests that the user thinks are serial (meaning: not concurrent; one fully after another).\nFor example: the user writes \"I ate cockroaches\" and clicks \"Save\", and you send an AJAX request to the backend. Now the user realizes the typo, writes \"I hate cockroaches\" and hits \"Save\" again. You immediately send an AJAX request again, even if the first one hasn't finished yet.\n\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant F as Frontend\n  participant N as Network (abstract)\n  participant B as Backend\n\n  F ->> N: set bio: \"I ate cockroaches\"\n\n  note right of N: (Some time passes.)\n\n  F ->> N: set bio: \"I hate cockroaches\"\n  N ->>+ B: set bio: \"He hates cockroaches\"\n  B -->>- N: OK\n  N -->> F: OK\n\n  note right of N: (First message finally gets delivered.)\n\n  N ->>+ B: set bio: \"He ate cockroaches\"\n  B -->>- N: Weird but OK\n  N -->> F: OK\n\n\nNow, the previous request might not even have reached the backend yet. In fact, the next one may take a different path and reach the backend first. So the backend first processes \"set Twitter bio to 'I hate cockroaches'\", and, once the first request arrives, it processes \"set Twitter bio to 'I ate cockroaches'\". The user thinks they fixed the typo, but, from the backend's perspective, they introduced it later!\nThis situation can be fixed by telling the backend the order in which messages are supposed to be processed. There are several ways to do this; instead of \"do this\" and \"do that\", messages might take the form \"1. do this\" and \"2. do that\", or \"do this, as a first action\" and \"do that, after action 'do this'\". The backend can then detect messages received out of order, and act consequently.\nWith ordering preservation in place, we have the whole receipt for eventual agreement:\n\nIf you do a series of idempotent operations, retry each of them until you see them succeed, and the backend preserves the order in which you sent them, then the backend and you agree on exactly which operations have been performed by you.\n\nThis is a powerful guarantee that we'll explore in depth in the \"Distributed data\" section.\nTCP has your back, except not really\nIn fact, communications do this all the time behind our backs. Most of the Internet runs on a protocol called TCP that has retries, idempotency, and ordering preservation built in.\nBut TCP can't fully save you:\n\nYou rarely send all your communications between two computers through a single TCP connection. For example, in the \"set Twitter bio\" AJAX example before, each AJAX operation is a HTTP request, which browsers will typically send in different TCP connections.\n\nEven if you do, TCP is a transport layer protocol: it just copies chunks of data from one computer to another and calls it a day. But operations are more than just meaningless data: they're application level, things that are processed and have consequences. You typically require confirmation by the backend that things were processed, because just receiving well-formed messages (what TCP guarantees) is only the beginning of the backend's job. So, just like TCP guarantees both ends eventually agree on which chunks of data were transferred, you need to guarantee your frontend and your backend agree on which operations were performed (if you want!).\n\n\nIf you send message \"42. pay 1000 USD to Alice\" twice over the same TCP connection, TCP will happily ensure your backend receives something like:\nrequest arrived: '\"42. pay 1000 USD to Alice\"';\nrequest arrived: '\"42. pay 1000 USD to Alice\"';\ninstead of an incomprehensible mess of arbitrarily duplicated, reordered, and missing chunks of data, like:\nved: '\"42. pay 10request arrirequest arri00 USD to Alicrequest are\"';\nAlice\"';\nAlice\"';\nrequest arrived:\nBut it's up to your backend to ensure that you don't do operation 42 twice!\n"},"001-programming-a-backend/02-serving-an-api.html":{"url":"001-programming-a-backend/02-serving-an-api.html","title":"Serving an API","keywords":"","body":"Serving an API\nServices are served by servers to clients\nComputers talk to each other in all sorts of ways. For programming backends, we're not that interested in many of them; for example, we're not going to look into peer-to-peer communication models, such as BitTorrent or Bitcoin. (Although both are technically fascinating!)\nThe communication model that is most used between frontends and backends, and between different parts of backends, is the client-server model.\nIn the client-server model, there's some kind of service being, well, served. Then, there are two roles for participating computers:\n\nComputers that use the service, called clients.\nThose that serve the service, called servers.\n\nWe'll explore the relationship between clients and servers in detail in this chapter.\nProtocols: the language in which computers talk\nClients and servers must share a common understanding on how to communicate: a protocol.\nIn practice, a protocol is really a composition of protocols from different layers. On low-level layers, computers agree on the basics about how to communicate. By using standard protocols for those layers, you can get advantage of existing tools that know about those protocols, such as routers, operating systems and web browser, and focus on what makes your use case different.\nThere are protocols that:\n\nWork out the details of how to find a computer in the network: IP, DNS.\nJust move data between computers: TCP (reliable, but heavyweight), UDP (not reliable, but lightweight).\nEncrypt the data, to avoid tampering and ensure privacy: TLS.\nDescribe ways of shaping this data into messages, and how messages are sequenced: HTTP, JSON-RPC, gRPC, WebSockets.\n\nWays of serving\nDifferent protocols implement different patterns of communication between clients and servers. Let's explore some of those.\nRequests get responses\nThe most common way of serving services is by accepting messages from clients, called requests, that specify what they want the service to do for them; and, after some work is done, sending a message back to the client, called a response, with some kind of feedback about the request.\n\nsequenceDiagram\n  client ->>+ server: make me a sandwich\n  activate client\n  note right of server: *mumble* *rumble*\n  server ->>- client: ðŸ¥ª\n  deactivate client\n\n\nThis is, for instance, how HTTP works. Each time you visit a web page, you're being a client of a service; the browser sends a HTTP request to the servers, that respond with content.\nDon't push to me, I'll pull from you\nWhen you go to the hospital, you don't just immediately go into the doctor's office, sit down and start telling them your pains and sorrows right away, without even minding if there's already some other patient in there. Instead, you wait in a room for the doctor to call you when they're ready to serve your request.\nThis is pull-based serving, as opposed to push-based. It's mostly used when, rather than expecting a meaningful response from the server, the client provides the data to the server, without being really interested in a response from it.\nHere, the request is sent from the server to the client, and the client responds to it.\n\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant client\n  participant server\n  server ->> client: need your data\n  client ->> server: have all this data, enjoy\n\n\nThe advantage of pulling data instead of waiting for it to be pushed is that the server decides when to pull it, which can be more efficient, since the server knows better than the client when it's preferable to have the data.\nStreams of responses\nSometimes, instead of expecting a response to a request as soon as possible, clients expect a series of responses, being sent whenever they are ready. Think something like chat: as people post messages, they're delivered to you.\n\nsequenceDiagram\n  client ->>+ server: connect to chat\n  activate client\n  server ->> client: OK, hang on for messages\n\n  note right of server: (Some time passes.)\n\n  Alice ->>+ server: hi!\n  activate Alice\n  server ->>- Alice: OK\n  deactivate Alice\n\n  server ->> client: Alice says: hi!\n\n  note right of server: (Some time passes.)\n\n  Bob ->>+ server: I'm here too!\n  activate Bob\n\n  Alice ->>+ server: how are you?\n  activate Alice\n\n  server ->>- Alice: OK\n  deactivate Alice\n\n  server ->> client: Alice says: how are you?\n\n  server ->>- Bob: OK\n  deactivate Bob\n\n  server ->> client: Bob says: I'm here too!\n\n  deactivate client\n\n\nThis is useful when the client wants to be notified when events happen as soon as possible after they happen.\nA downside is that both client and server need to keep the stream open, which, as we'll extensively see, consumes system resources.\nWeb protocols that enable streams: SSE, WebSocket.\nLong polling\nYou can trick a request-response protocol into behaving like a stream. The trick is to send a request and, instead of expecting a response right away, let the server respond only once a new event arrives. Once you get the response, you send the request again.\n\nsequenceDiagram\n  client ->>+ server: get me messages\n  activate client\n\n  note right of server: (Some time passes.)\n\n  Alice ->>+ server: hi!\n  activate Alice\n  server ->>- Alice: OK\n  deactivate Alice\n\n  server ->>- client: Alice says: hi!\n  deactivate client\n  client ->>+ server: get me messages\n  activate client\n\n  note right of server: (Some time passes.)\n\n  Bob ->>+ server: I'm here too!\n  activate Bob\n\n  Alice ->>+ server: how are you?\n  activate Alice\n\n  server ->>- Alice: OK\n  deactivate Alice\n\n  server ->>- client: Alice says: how are you?\n  deactivate client\n\n  server ->>- Bob: OK\n  deactivate Bob\n\n  client ->>+ server: get me messages\n  activate client\n  server ->>- client: Bob says: I'm here too!\n\n  deactivate client\n\n\nThe main advantage of this is that you can use a request-response protocol, such as HTTP, which are more ubiquitous and thus are familiar to more clients developers and have more libraries available for all kinds of platforms.\nStream from A to B + stream from B to A = connection\nIf, instead of from server to client only, messages are streamed in both directions, we have a connection.\nGoing back to the chat application, we had:\n\nA stream-based protocol for retrieving messages.\nA request-response protocol for posting messages.\n\nIt's more efficient to just have a single connection for both. This has basically no resources overhead over plain streams, and spares us the overhead of the request-response protocol.\nA connection-based protocol available in Web browsers is WebSockets.\nApplication Programing Interface\nOnce you've decided how your server will communicate with its clients, you must choose a stack of standard protocols that best match your needs, and, on top of those, add a protocol that you define. The protocol that is specific to an application is usually called the API.\nThe API is the external interface that a system exposes to let others build programs on top of it.\nIt is different from a user interface, which is supposed to be used by a person directly through human-friendly input and output methods: buttons, commands, text, images, etc.\nInstead, an API is supposed to be used programmatically, by writing code.\nIn the case of servers, APIs are exposed to clients through the network, on top of other protocols that deal with communication details.\nEven though APIs are for machines to call, it's people the ones writing the code that deals with them. Bad APIs make people miserable and systems brittle. While what constitutes a good API is, as with most aspects of human interaction, fairly subjective, there are a few principles that are a necessary factor in designing good APIs.\nAn API is a contract\nThe first and most crucial requirement for a good API is that it is well defined.\nAPIs get old\nHere's a fact of life: you will want to change your API. Here's another: you won't be able to, because there will be clients depending on it.\nThe code your clients are using to access your old API won't magically change at exactly the same time your server stop serving it. Mobile apps won't get updated, browser tabs won't refresh, services depending on yours won't be deployed until after some time passes, or, in the worst case, never.\nBackwards-compatible additions\nInstead of changing your API, consider adding things to it.\nState very clearly which kind of additions are considered backwards-compatible. A good list would include:\n\nAdding kinds of requests: methods, endpoints, resources, etc.\nAdding fields to object types.\nAdding parameters to kinds of requests, if the protocol allows it: query parameters in URLs, optional arguments in methods, etc.\n\nVersioning\nWhen breaking changes can't be avoided, it's best to keep running the old API alongside the new one.\nClients should be told that the should update to take advantage of the new, better API.\nProgrammer-friendliness\nIn the end, a programmer is the one that needs to understand and adapt to your API. A good API is designed with this in mind.\nBeing friendly to people is more art than science. It entails things like being simple, powerful, easy to use, flexible, etc. But let's see a few recommendations that are usually programmer-friendly APIs.\nFollow conventions\nYours is not the only API programmers have seen or will see in their lives. If your API resembles those they already knew, you can leverage that familiarity in order to reduce friction.\nThere will probably be libraries, tools, etc. built around those conventions.\nGive good error feedback\nUse precisely codified errors and informative error messages in your responses to faulty requests.\nKeep ceremony to a minimum\nSet sane defaults when they make sense. But careful: this is a slippery slope. You might end up doing things by default that are annoying or surprising to many people.\nProvide client libraries\nSpecially when your API is complex, providing a client library may be a good idea.\nA client library should not be substitute for a good platform-agnostic API: platforms change, and you might end up inducing more friction.\nTCP connections and your API\nIdeally, when serving your API, you wouldn't need to care too much about the underlying protocols. Things would just work beneath you.\nIn practice, when things go wrong, those foundational protocols break and your API is affected. If you want your API to be well-defined, you can't escape from that fact. Effectively, the underlying protocols are part of your API.\nIn particular, TCP is such a fundamental protocol that is is worth knowing in some detail how it affects your API.\nDelivery guarantees\nAs long as the connection is not broken, TCP ensures that the data you send is received:\n\nEventually\nOnly once\nIn the order it was sent\nIncorrupt\n\nServer: cancel work when the connection dies\nThere are three ways a connection should be declared dead:\n\nYou receive a FIN when you expected the other end to keep sending data. In Node.js, this manifests itself as an end event emitted on the net.Socket or a http.Client object.\nYou receive a RST. This means the other end has declared the connection as broken and tells you to do so too, for whatever reason. This is the \"connection reset by peer\" error that manifests itself as an error event emitted on the request object.\nThe connection times out.\n\nYou should listen to those events, propagate them, and stop doing things in your request handler as soon as possible.\nClient: close the connection if you don't need a response anymore\nIn the browser's XMLHTTPRequest, call the abort method.\nIn Node.js's http.ClientRequest, call the destroy method.\nRPC\nRPC means Remote Procedure Call.\nIt basically means that you send a request and get a response, similarly to how you would call a procedure (a method or a function) and get a return value in your programming language.\nHTTP as a transport\nHTTP is a protocol on top of TCP designed to interact with hypertext, that is, Web pages. But, since there's a lot of tooling already in place for HTTP, it's usual to rely on it as a transport layer for RPC.\nJSON-RPC\nJSON-RPC is a particular way of encoding RPC calls in HTTP, using JSON.\nThe nice thing about JSON-RPC is that there are tons of libraries available for it, in many platforms.\nREST\nIn REST, you define your API in terms of resources. A resource is something that can be retrieved, maybe modified, and maybe deleted.\nCRUD operations:\n\nGET\nReads a resource.\nCacheable.\nMust be idempotent.\n\n\nPOST\nWrites a resource, or provoke an effect of some kind.\nNot necessarily idempotent.\nBut you need to make it idempotent if you want strong delivery guarantees, to safely support retries.\n\n\n\n\nPUT\nWrites a resource by replacing it wholly.\nMust be idempotent.\n\n\nDELETE\nDeletes a resource.\nMust be idempotent.\n\n\nPATCH\nReplaces just part of a resource. Pretty error-prone; usually not worth it.\n\n\n\nThis is how browsers work, mostly.\nVirtually all platforms have good support for RESTful APIs.\nProvides familiar semantics. Or that's the myth. In practice, it's not that well understood, and you'll find yourself shoehorning things into it, since not everything can be expressed in terms of resources.\nBecause of this, just declaring your API as \"RESTful\" doesn't mean there's no need to define your API in very precise terms.\nREST also requires you to respond with semantically valid status codes:\n\n200-299: Things went well.\n400-499: Something went bad, because of the client.\n500-599: Something went bad, because of the server.\n\nYou can get fancy, or you can stick to:\n\n200 OK\n400 Bad Request\n401 Unauthorized\n403 Forbidden\n404 Not Found\n500 Internal Server Error\n503 Service Unavailable\n\nDeriving code from contracts\nMany tools let you derive both client and server code from a common language that specifies part of your contract. This is nice because it enforces that part of the contract in a uniform, robust way, so that you can focus on the other parts.\n"},"001-programming-a-backend/03-the-backends-backends.html":{"url":"001-programming-a-backend/03-the-backends-backends.html","title":"The backend's backends","keywords":"","body":"The backend's backends\nFailures don't end with communication\nThe picture we've painted so far may look like this: to accomplish some task, computers talk to one another through a dark, misty, treacherous Ocean of Uncertainty in which messages get lost, sink, or are left adrift indefinitely; but, once a lucky message makes it to the other side of this ocean, all trouble is then behind, the recipient does its part of the task with full reliability, and only when it's time to send another message back with a response does the possibility of failure come back again.\nIf only things were so easy! The truth is, this picture is missing two extra sources of failures:\n\nThe recipient may crash at any point while processing a message.\nThe recipient's part of the task may involve communicating with one or more extra computers, so:\nAs we know, those communications can fail.\nThose computers can also crash.\nThose computers may, in turn, communicate with even more computers.\n\n\n\nBut this should not lead us to pessimism. In fact, distributed systems can be made more reliable than any system running in a single computer can dream of. When you're done with this course, you will have a pretty complete overview of the main techniques to achieve that reliability. You will have attained the ability to create programs with superpowers that outlive any fallible machine that runs them and overcome however many obstacles are put in their way.\nSo, with that in mind, let's see what we can do about failure in the backend, and in the backend's backends.\nLet it crash\nServer-side recovery\nA common way of thinking when attempting to build robustness into a backend is to recover as much as possible from errors in the backend itself: catch all exceptions, think hard about all possible combinations of failed states and come up with ways to reach a more desirable state from those.\nCrashes will happen, anyway\nHere's the thing: there's always the possibility of crashes. A machine can just die, for all sorts of reasons. At any point of a backend's execution. If you want your distributed program to actually be reliable, it needs to recover from that scenario. Since backends can die, it follows that you can't rely on the backend to recover from its own failures: it might be too dead to do anything useful. The sophisticated damage control mechanisms you have put in place won't even have a chance to make things right if the program that runs them just halts.\nGiven this fact of life, you can actually take advantage of it to make your system simpler. Given the other components of the system already have to consider the possibility of your death, whenever you find yourself in a not-so-ideal state, just crash!\nCrashing gently\nIt's worth clarifying what we mean by crash here, as something that your program does as opposed to something that happens to it. It basically means to act as if the computer was suddenly turned off, that is, stop operations immediately. With some caveats:\n\nLimit the crash to the context in which the error happened. If you're handling a request, just abort the request handler, not the whole program!\nIf someone is waiting for a response from you, try to actively inform them of the crash as soon as possible. You should send a suitable error response, and/or abruptly close the TCP connection, if applies. This allows the other side to recover as soon as possible from your failure.\nReport as much debug information as it might be useful. We'll see how in further chapters.\n\nThis technique is called let it crash: crashing is nothing to be worried about if someone else, somewhere else is expecting it to happen, so... just let it crash!\nAs with any other general technique in programming, this one isn't to be applied blindly at every occasion. Sometimes, it can be justified to have some degree of recovery in the backend itself. Handling crashes usually involves some amount of service degradation, and recovering from errors in the backend can reduce it, at the cost of a more complex system with more possible states to consider. Use your judgement to decide if this complexity is justified or not. Just know that it's optional, and it shouldn't affect system-wide robustness if the system is designed right.\nCrashes are indistinguishable from failed communications\nWe've put a lot of faith in someone else, somewhere else to recover from our crashes. That someone, somewhere can just be the computer that is waiting for your response. And, turns out, we've already seen what to do to recover from crashes on the server, from the client's perspective.\nThe key insight here is that a crash and a failed communication look the same to the client. You wanted a response, be it some result value or just some kind of acknowledgment that the message is processed successfully, and you didn't get it in time. The only difference is that, for efficiency (to reduce waits) and debuggability purposes, you may have received an error response (in the 5xx range, if you're speaking HTTP), a connection broken event, or some other kind of failure signal instead of a timeout.\nSo you do exactly the same as you would do on a timeout. This reduces the complexity of your distributed recovery mechanism significantly by having a unified strategy that works in all scenarios.\nPartial failures\nA backend usually acts as a coordinator for other backends. Sometimes, this involves causing several effects that are independent of each other. For example, you might want to send an email and then (or in parallel) save something in a database.\nGiven that those effects are the result of messages sent in a distributed system, they can fail, as any other distributed operation. And, given they're independent from each other, they can fail independently.\nIf some operations succeeded while others failed or weren't even attempted, then we have partial failure.\nPartial failure is usually trickier to handle than total failure. You typically want either all effects or none of them to take place. On partial failure, the robust thing to do is to try to move the system towards one of those two states, so that things aren't left half-done.\nThe recovery approach: undo or retry\nLet's consider two choices:\n\nUndo the operations that succeeded. This moves the system towards the total failure state.\nRetry the operations that failed. This moves the system towards the total success state.\n\nBut there are problems with those strategies:\n\nUndoing may not be possible at all. For example, you can't unsend an email.\nRetrying may trigger duplicate effects, if the original attempt yielded just a communication failure which didn't correspond to an operational failure: the operation arrived but its acknowledgement got lost, or it will arrive eventually.\nUndoing and retrying are distributed operations themselves, and thus can also fail. So we keep retrying them too? For how long?\nIf the program crashes, the pending undo or retry operations will never happen, unless they're preventively put in a job queue before and then canceled somehow. (We'll see more about queues in time.)\n\nBoth are quite complicated solutions that fall into server-side recovery strategy. How can we fit partial failures in a let it crash strategy?\nThe let it crash approach: idempotency + retry all\nActually, we already know what to do. We know from the first chapter than, in order to be robust, a distributed operation needs to be idempotent, so that it can be retried as many times as necessary to get confirmation that it succeed.\nThis means that we should be already planning for the possibility that the current operation (that is, the one processed by your backend, which coordinates the independent sub-operations that we're discussing) is retried by the client, even if there's no failure at all in the backend. This means that the operation needs to be made idempotent.\nWe can take advantage of this when partial failure occurs. We just follow let it crash: we just treat partial failure as total failure and crash the request handling.\nThis is supposed to trigger a retry from the client. The retry will, in turn, cause the backend to retry its sub-operations, even those that had succeeded before, if there were any.\nThis retry may fail too, either partially or fully, but that would in turn trigger another retry.\nSince those sub-operations are also idempotent, it doesn't matter if they were previously successful or not. If they were successful, then retrying will have no effect. If they had failed in a previous attempt, then maybe this time they will succeed.\nEventually, after enough retries, all sub-operations will have succeeded.\nThe end-to-end robustness of idempotency + retries\nIf, at this point, you're still not convinced that idempotency combined with continued retries from the client is the way to go, let us recall what it has bought us so far:\n\nIt recovers from messages that get lost, arbitrarily delayed, or duplicated in an unreliable medium.\nIt recovers from crashes in the server.\nIt recovers from partial failures in the server, by eventually achieving total success of all sub-operations.\n\nThis works no matter how many levels of client-server relationships we're on. Consider a tree of operations like this:\n\ngraph LR\n  frontend --> backend\n  backend --> database\n  backend --> cache\n  backend --> microservice\n  microservice --> dbcreate[database create]\n  microservice --> mailer\n  microservice --> dbsave[database save]\n\n\nSay that a request from frontend to backend results in requests to all those systems, as part of the backend's operation. Consider what happens if mailer fails:\n\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant frontend\n  participant backend\n  participant database\n  participant cache\n  participant microservice\n  participant mailerdb as database\n  participant mailer\n\n  frontend ->> backend: do op 1\n  backend ->> database: set foo=42 from op 1\n  database ->> backend: OK, stored\n  backend ->> cache: set foo=42 from op 1\n  cache ->> backend: OK, stored\n  backend ->> microservice: send email from op 1\n  microservice ->> mailerdb: create new email from op 1\n  mailerdb ->> microservice: OK, created\n  microservice ->> mailer: send a mail from op 1\n  mailer ->> microservice: ðŸš¨ crash! ðŸš¨\n  microservice ->> backend: ðŸš¨ crash! ðŸš¨\n  backend ->> frontend: ðŸš¨ crash! ðŸš¨\n\n  Note left of frontend: Well, let's retry\n\n  frontend ->> backend: do op 1\n  backend ->> database: set foo=42 from op 1\n  database ->> backend: already did!\n  backend ->> cache: set foo=42 from op 1\n  cache ->> backend: already did!\n  backend ->> microservice: send email from op 1\n  microservice ->> mailerdb: create new email from op 1\n  mailerdb ->> microservice: already did!\n  microservice ->> mailer: send a mail from op 1\n  mailer ->> microservice: OK, sent\n  microservice ->> mailerdb: mark email as sent from op 1\n  mailerdb ->> microservice: OK, done\n  microservice ->> backend: OK, done\n  backend ->> frontend: OK, done\n\n\nCan we trust clients to retry?\nThe problem with this approach to fixing partial failures it that usually you need the client to retry. If it doesn't, then your system might be stuck in an intermediate state.\nIf the client is a frontend, e. g. a browser or a mobile phone, you need an intermediate that reliably retries on failure if you really care about reaching a consistent state, because state in user devices is not durable.\nYou can also just have a garbage collector.\n\nCanceling work\nThe client could attempt to notify the server if they stop being interested in an operation. The server should then propagate this notification to their backends and crash the request handler. This prevents unnecessary work.\nA robust way of doing so is by breaking the connection. This is what happens if the user closes the browser tab, for example, so you can take advantage of that.\nBeware of inconsistent state, though. A broken connection means the client won't retry anymore, so consider that, as above.\n\n"},"002-distributed-data/":{"url":"002-distributed-data/","title":"Distributed data","keywords":"","body":"Distributed data\n"},"002-distributed-data/01-contradictions.html":{"url":"002-distributed-data/01-contradictions.html","title":"Contradictions","keywords":"","body":"Contradictions\nFrontends outnumber the backend\nSo far, we've studied the conversations between a frontend and a backend, that is, a computer running a frontend program and a computer running a backend program, including the derived conversations between this backend and other backend servers (databases, mailers, etc.).\n\ngraph LR\n  frontend --- backend\n  backend --- database\n  backend --- cache\n  backend --- mailer\n  backend --- ...\n\n\nBut, of course, we know that's usually not all participants in our little distributed system. It actually looks like this:\n\ngraph LR\n  frontend1[\"frontend\"] --- backend\n  frontend2[\"frontend\"] --- backend\n  frontend3[\"frontend\"] --- backend\n  frontend4[\"frontend\"] --- backend\n  frontend5[\"frontend\"] --- backend\n  frontend6[\"frontend\"] --- backend\n  frontend7[\"frontend\"] --- backend\n  frontend8[\"... more frontends ...\"] --- backend\n  backend --- database\n  backend --- cache\n  backend --- mailer\n  backend --- ...\n\n\nUnless we have a single user, we have many frontend computers talking with our backend at the same time.\nSide note: beware of your development setup bias\nActually, there's a scenario in which you'll usually have a single frontend talking to your backend at any given time: when developing. You'll typically open your browser, go to localhost:something, and see if whatever you're building works.\nThis is a huge source of bias. You should be aware at all times that your local system reflects only very poorly your real production system. Some ways in which your local environment is different:\n\nYou will rarely experience contradictions.\nThe local network is very fast and reliable. (In particular, if you're targeting mobile users, I'd say you must use a network limiter.)\nIt runs in a laptop instead of a server, or a series of servers. Hardware is different.\nIt probably isn't as virtualized as the server.\nThe server sustains way more load.\nThe server is probably running other programs that may steal resources from your backend.\n\nFrontends share memory\nIf every communication between a frontend and a backend were completely isolated from the others, then this wouldn't be a problem at all. But, usually, there is some shared memory in place: a database, a cache.\nThis opens up the possibility of contradictions. A participant may assume that the shared memory has something in it, but in reality it has something else.\nSequential, concurrent, distributed\nActually, this chapter isn't really about distributed systems. As we've seen, distributed systems are all about communication through an unreliable network. But, even if communication happened through a completely reliable network with guaranteed bounded delay, we would still have several participants sharing memory, and thus the possibility of contradictions.\nEverything in this chapter actually applies to concurrent systems, of which distributed systems are a subset.\nSequential system\n\nA sequential system, or just process, is the basic building block of computing: some instructions run one after another, reading and storing bits in a piece of memory that nobody else uses, in a completely reliable way. A read or a write to that memory effectively stops the world.\nConcurrent system\nIf we take several processes running at the same time and give them access to the same piece of memory, we get a concurrent system. This piece of memory is also accessed in a completely reliable way.\n\nNote that, by leaving each other \"messages\" in the shared memory, concurrent processes may communicate. In fact, this capacity of reliable communication between processes is the really fundamental thing about concurrent systems. In practice, concurrent processes communicate through shared memory, but on some programming models this shared memory is abstracted away.\nDistributed system\nWhen we make several processes running at the same time communicate through an unreliable medium, we get a distributed system.\n\nDistributed systems are inherently concurrent, since we find in them sequential processes communicating with each other. But we may find concurrent systems that are not distributed.\nRelated events\nWhen processes run, they produce events, things that happen: this piece of memory gets read, this gets written, this page gets printed, etc. Computing is nothing but a succession of such events.\nWhen considering a sequential process, all events have an intrinsic, implicit relationship between them: each event either happens before or after another event.\nEvents can have an additional relationship: one event may depend on another. If event A wouldn't have happened if event B wouldn't have happened before A, we say that B causes A, or that A depends on B. We call this a causal relationship.\nIf two events aren't causally related, then it doesn't matter in which order they are run: the end state of the process's memory afterwards will be exactly the same.\nConsider the following assignments in a sequential system:\nfoo = 42\nbar = qux * 2\n\nThe end result of those is exactly the same as:\nbar = qux * 2\nfoo = 42\n\nNow, consider something like this:\nfoo = 42\nbar = foo * 2\n\nNow we can't just swap the two assignments, since the effects of the second assignment depends on the assignment of foo happening before.\nWhen we introduce concurrent processes into the equation, we open up the possibility of two events not being bound by a happens-before relationship. By running them in different concurrent processes, neither happens before the other.\n\nIf two events aren't causally related, then A and B may happen in any order, including at the same time.\n\nBut causally related event must be also related in time.\n\nIf event A depends on event B, then B must happen before event A.\n\nSo, if event A depends on event B, must A and B happen in the same sequential process? Not necessarily.\n\nGiven that event A depends on event B, A and B can happen in two different concurrent processes if the process that runs A communicates A to the process that runs B.\n\nWhen two concurrent processes communicate in a controlled manner, establishing a happens-before relationship between the events one has produced and the other will produce, then we say they synchronize.\nConcurrent systems in the wild\nTime-sharing processes\nYour computer is, at any time, running a bunch of programs at the same time. Each instance of a running program is called a process.\nEach process has its own address space, a chunk of memory that only that process can access.\nThe operating system is in charge of making a process execute by letting it run in a CPU for a while, then hitting pause on it, letting another process run in its place, pausing that one, and so on. It does so for all available CPU cores in the machine. By doing this fast enough, if effectively looks like all processes are executing at the same time, as concurrent processes. This is called scheduling.\nThe OS provides tools to achieve inter-process communication (IPC). Some of them are:\n\nFiles and pipes.\nShared memory (shm).\nNetwork sockets, either in a real network, in localhost (a \"virtual\" network), or as domain sockets.\nSignals.\n\nThreads\nActually, the OS doesn't schedule processes, but threads. A process has at least one thread (called the main thread), but it may spawn more of those.\nEach thread has its own stack, but they all share address space, so they can do things like reading and writing to the same variables.\nA thread can communicate with another thread by writing in a shared variable that the other thread then reads.\nWriting or reading a variable is usually not an atomic operation. In the middle of writing or reading, the thread might be paused by the operating system. If then another thread reads it, it may see a half-written variable, or, by writing on it, cause the original thread to see so when it comes back. This can happen too if two threads are running in different CPUs and happen to access the variable at the same time.\nTo fix this, the system provides atomic synchronization mechanisms such as mutexes, semaphores, and condition variables.\nEvent loop\nThis is the JavaScript model: there's a single thread, but, when encountering a blocking operation (a network operation, an access to disk, a wait), instead of waiting for it to finish, a callback is registered.\nThis callback will be enqueued for being called when the blocking operation for which it was registered finishes, producing an event.\nThe running thread eventually finishes the current call stack, ideally pretty quickly since it doesn't wait for anything blocking to finish. When it does, then the event loop takes over control of the the thread. It looks in the queue of callbacks that want to be called, pops one of them, and calls it. The process just repeats until the process dies.\nWhen you don't know in which order two callbacks will be called by the event loop, they are for all intents and purposes concurrent.\nTwo concurrent callbacks can communicate by closing over the same variable and accessing it from both.\nSince there's a single thread, accessing a variable is atomic. This makes things easier, but bugs based on assuming that variables don't change in between callbacks can still happen, since they can break causality.\nGreen threads\nThis is kind of a hybrid between threads and an event loop. As far as concurrency is concerned, though, they are basically equivalent to threads, except that, depending on the exact model, accessing variables without other synchronization mechanisms in place may or may not be atomic.\nRace conditions\nA race condition is a type of bug in which we fail to codify the causality of two events properly. We wanted event A to depend on event B, but instead it ends up depending on some other event.\nRace conditions are hard because our programming languages are inherently sequential. We tend to codify causal dependencies as just happen-before relationships; that is, if we want A to depend on B, our programming languages lead us to believe that we just have to do B after A. This doesn't take into account events that may have taken place in between B and A happen in our process, which could break relationship.\nThink about this pair of concurrent processes:\nProcess 1\nfoo = 42; // A\nbar = foo * 2; // B\n\nProcess 2\nfoo = 1337; // C\n\nIf foo is a shared variable of some kind, and you intended event B to depend on event A, then this code has, at least, one race condition, because B might be depending on C instead.\nSynchronization mechanisms\nTo avoid race conditions, we need to synchronize concurrent processes so that the intended causality relationships are enforced. Let's examine a few ways of synchronizing.\nAtomic operations\nAn operation is atomic when no concurrent event can affect it.\nLocks\nLocks, also called mutexes (from mutual exclusion), are probably the most ubiquitous synchronization mechanism. All others can be implemented with it.\nA lock is a shared object that concurrent threads acquire and then release, with the invariant that only one process may have the lock at the same time.\nOur example above could be fixed by doing this:\nProcess 1\nlock(); // L1\nfoo = 42; // A\nbar = foo * 2; // B\nunlock(); // U1\n\nProcess 2\nlock(); // L2\nfoo = 1337; // C\nunlock(); // U2\n\nThis ensures that B actually depends on A. The key is that there's an enforced happens-before relationship between the whole group of events L1+A+B+U1 and L2+C+U2. We don't know the order in which the two groups will happen, but we know that events from one process won't happen before events from the other have happened.\nLocks are tricky to get right: you can fall into deadlocks if by accidentally making a process that has the lock depend on itself to release the lock to continue.\nAtomic load and writeÂ¡\nIn JavaScript, reading and writing to variables is atomic. In databases, load and writing a single object is also typically atomic. In other runtimes that preempt threads or allows concurrent reads and writes, additional ceremony is necessary.\nIncrement and decrement\nAgain, since in JavaScript you know that everything that happens within a function call is atomic, doing this:\na = a + 1;\n\nis atomic. But in other runtimes, including most databases, a concurrent process may assign some value Y for a in between a is read with some value X and then assigned to X + 1. Then, value Y will be lost.\nCompare-and-swap\nAtomically execute something like:\nfunction compareAndSwap(newValue, expectedCurrent) {\n  let current = a;\n  if (current == expectedCurrent) {\n    a = newValue;\n  }\n  return current;\n}\n\nThis is a powerful primitive that lets us check that our assumption about the current value of the shared variable is still what we thought it is, probably from a previous read, before setting it to a new value. This prevents losing writes.\nA particularly useful way of using this is \"set if unset and return current value\". This lets concurrent process agree on some value, it doesn't matter which.\nA variant, compare-and-set, doesn't return the current value, but just whether our assumption was true:\nfunction compareAndSet(newValue, expectedCurrent) {\n  let current = a;\n  if (current == expectedCurrent) {\n    a = newValue;\n  }\n  return current == expectedCurrent;\n}\n\nMongoDB's findAndModify implements a compare-and-set operation.\nOptimistic locking\nTransactions\nIsolation levels\nDistributed synchronization\nDistributed locks\nDistributed transactions\nTwo-phase commit\nHandling concurrent requests\nThe single-threaded model\nAs championed by Redis. Just run every request sequentially. Be fast. Trivially serializable.\nThe event loop model\nUse a single thread, but make the reaction to a blocking operation happen latter, letting other requests sneak in in the meantime.\nThe (green?) threaded model\nEach request is handled by a separate thread or even a process. There might be a thread pool, or one thread per concurrent process.\nRace detection\nDeterministic merges\nWrites declare read dependencies\n\n"},"002-distributed-data/02-persistent-state.html":{"url":"002-distributed-data/02-persistent-state.html","title":"Persistent state","keywords":"","body":"Persistent state\nHow real is our success confirmation?\nWe've seen that, when someone asks us to do some operation, either:\n\nWe do it completely and respond with a success confirmation (an acknowledgment, or ack, for short).\nWe do it partially (or not at all) and crash.\n\nFrom the perspective of the client, we know that we can't make any assumption about the success of the operation if we don't get a confirmation response in time.\nBut if we do get an ack, what does it mean, exactly?\nThe simplistic assumption to make is that all consequences of our request are, at and after that point, completely and permanently in effect.\nFor instance, I might assume that, after I get confirmation that foo=42 has been saved in a database, and nobody else overwrites such save, then every subsequent query for foo to the database will get 42.\n\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant c1 as client 1\n  participant db as database\n  participant c2 as client 2\n  participant c3 as client 3\n\n  Note right of db: foo=13\n\n  c2 ->> db: get foo\n  db ->> c2: 13\n\n  c1 ->> db: set foo=42\n  Note right of db: foo=42\n  db ->> c1: ok\n\n  c2 ->> db: get foo\n  db ->> c2: 42\n\n  c3 ->> db: get foo\n  db ->> c3: 42\n\n  c1 ->> db: get foo\n  db ->> c1: 42\n\n\nSadly, this is isn't realistic.\nWhen hard disks break\nThe database is stored in a hard disk somewhere. At some point, this hard disk will stop working.\nIn this scenario, it's obvious that the assumption that we did above doesn't hold anymore. The acknowledgment that we get from the database just means that subsequent queries probably will get the value we stored. But it can also be lost forever.\nNeedless to say, a system that just loses its data from time to time is probably providing a terrible service, depending on our needs.\nSo there's a tension between:\n\nThe fact that disks die.\nOur preference for acknowledged operation's consequences to persist in time.\n\nBackups\nA first step to address the problem of disks dying is to make backups. If a disk dies, then we just swap it by one its backups. (We call this process a failover.)\nConsidering just one backup (you probably want more than one):\n\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant c1 as client 1\n  participant db as database\n  participant backup as backup\n  participant c2 as client 2\n\n  Note right of db: Database:foo=13\n  Note right of backup: Backup:foo=13\n\n  c1 ->> db: set foo=42\n  Note right of db: Database:foo=42\n  Note right of backup: Backup:foo=13\n  db ->> c1: ok\n\n  c2 ->> db: get foo\n  db ->> c2: 42\n\n  Note right of db: Backup time!\n  db ->> backup: start backup (somehow)\n  Note right of db: Database:foo=42\n  Note right of backup: Backup:foo=42\n  backup ->> db: ok\n\n  Note right of db: Database is dead!

Lots of data won't have changed between a backup and the next, so copying the same data again is a waste of resources.\nIt introduces a lengthy period of inconsistency between a backup and the next. If the database fails during that interval, we'll fall back to data that can be badly outdated.\n\nWhat should we do instead? We can emit an event with each change that is processed as soon as possible. Instead of copying the data, we copy the events that change the data.\nThis is what we usually understand by replication. The \"backup\" databases are then called replicas or secondary (or slaves, which is failing into disuse), while the database that accepts write requests is called leader or primary (or master, which is also falling into disuse).\n\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant clients\n  participant db\n  participant backup\n\n  clients ->> db: foo=42\n  Note right of db: Database:foo=42\n  db ->> backup: foo=42\n  Note right of backup: Backup:foo=42\n  clients ->> db: bar=\"baz\"\n  Note right of db: Database:foo=42,bar=\"baz\"\n  db ->> backup: bar=\"baz\"\n  Note right of backup: Backup:foo=42,bar=\"baz\"\n  clients ->> db: qux=13.37\n  Note right of db: Database:foo=42,bar=\"baz\",qux=13.37\n  db ->> backup: qux=13.37\n  Note right of backup: Backup:foo=42,bar=\"baz\",qux=13.37\n  clients ->> db: a=123\n  Note right of db: Database:foo=42,bar=\"baz\",qux=13.37,a=123\n  db ->> backup: a=123\n  Note right of backup: Backup:foo=42,bar=\"baz\",qux=13.37,a=123\n  clients ->> db: foo=0\n  Note right of db: Database:foo=0,bar=\"baz\",qux=13.37,a=123\n  db ->> backup: foo=0\n  Note right of backup: Backup:foo=0,bar=\"baz\",qux=13.37,a=123\n\n\nSync vs. async\nIn the last chapter, we saw that two concurrent processes can collaborate by synchronizing, that is, establishing a point of communication after which they can safely set causal relationships between their new events and the other process's older events.\nIn simpler words, you let another process see some of the data that your events produced, so that it can do something with that data.\nA request and its response establish a window of synchronicity between the participants:\n\nThe request carries data from the client to the server.\nThe response, at the very least, signals to the client that the server did something with that data.\n\nThose are two synchronization events: the request can do things as a consequence of what happened on the client, and then, the client can do things as a consequence of the server having processed its request.\n\nWith this in mind, we can categorize the events that happen while handling a request (that is, in the server, between a request is received and its response is sent) as:\n\nSynchronous: The event happens in this window, before the response is sent.\nAsynchronous: Not synchronous. The event happens concurrently with the window: it may happen before or after the response is sent.\n\nThis is a useful distinction to which we will return in future chapters.\nTo consider a operation carried out as part of processing the request to be synchronous means that the server waits for its completion (either as an ack, or as a timeout) before responding to the client.\nOn the other hand, an asynchronous operation may be initiated inside the request handler, but it is not waited for completion before responding.\nAs often, there's no right way to do things; both doing things synchronously or asynchronously have their advantages.\nReplication strategies\nSynchronous replication\nSynchronous replication means that we don't acknowledge a save to the database as successful until saves to all the replicas are acknowledged as successful too.\nThis is useful because then, if a failover occurs, we're sure that we won't see an outdated version of the data, ie. a version that was overwritten at some point in the past by a successfully acknowledged write to the database.\nRemember the assumption we used above?\n\nFor instance, I might assume that, after I get confirmation that foo=42 has been saved in a database, and nobody else overwrites such save, then every subsequent query for foo to the database will get 42.\n\nUnder synchronous replication, this holds while there's at least one replica of the data accessible somewhere. As it is extremely unlikely that all replicas are dead at any given time, this strategy basically makes writes unforgettable, so it makes this assumption reasonable.\nThis strategy has two downsides:\n\nIf any single replica fails, we're under a partial failure scenario: some replicas may have the new data while others may not, so the system is left in an inconsistent state. The client needs to retry the operation to restore consistency.\nThe latency (the time since the client sends a request until it receives a response) of the whole operation is bounded by the latency of the slowest of the replicas.\n\nNote that this is equivalent to the let-it-crash strategy we've seen before for partial failures.\nAsynchronous replication\nUnder asynchronous replication, we acknowledge a save after we've persistently stored it in our primary database's disk, but we don't wait for saves to replicas to complete.\nThis allows us to respond quickly to a write request, but then we have no guarantee about whether or when the replicas will process the write.\nReplication lag\nAs we'll study in detail in future chapters, responding quickly by doing part of the work asynchronously doesn't magically make the work free. We basically trade off reduced latency by increased memory consumption and/or lost data.\nIn this case, since a write is acknowledged by the primary until it is processes by all async replicas, we need to store the fact that it happened somewhere, so that the replicas can consume the event from there. This somewhere is called the replication log.\nThe amount of time between a write enters this log and it is consumed by the slowest replica is called replication lag.\nIf one or more replicas become slow for some reason, or if they can't keep up with the pace of writes to the database, the replication lag will increase and the replication log will grow indefinitely, until it is too big to fit in wherever it is kept.\nAt that point, we can either start dropping data from it or stop accepting new writes.\nReading from replicas\nSo far, replicas have been just sitting there, keeping themselves up to date and waiting for a failover to being promoted to primary and have a chance to do something useful. But what if we put them to use before that?\nWe've seen two ways replicas may not be up-to-date with the leader:\n\nUnder asynchronous replication, the replication lag may not be zero.\nUnder synchronous replication, a write may have failed, leaving some replicas outdated.\n\nIf we can afford reading data that is not completely up-to-date, we can use replicas to perform reads.\nThis reduces reads-per-second in our primary database.\nLeaderless databases\nOK, so what if we don't just allow reads from replicas, but also writes?\nWell, to begin with, they stop being replicas. They're no longer storing replicated data that is also stored somewhere else, but, for a while at least, they hold data that no other machine holds.\nWhen more than one machine accept writes, we no longer have leaders: we have a leaderless database.\nIn this scenario, typically all machines that accept writes act as replicas to all other machines that accept writes. (There might be additional read-only replicas.)\nWhy would we want to do this?\n\nFailover is trivial: just retry the write in another machine.\nWe can scale by adding more machines: each machine will receive only a portion of the requests.\n\nQuorum\nBeing leaderless is independent of the replication strategy used, but it opens the door to a middle ground between synchronous and asynchronous replication: write synchronously to, and read synchronously from, only a majority of the machines, instead of all of them. This is called quorum consistency.\nThey key is that, if you write to a majority of machines, then a read to a majority of machines will necessarily overlap at least in one machine with the newest write. The read can then select the newest version of the retrieved data.\nThis greatly reduces the chances of inconsistency, at the expense of making writes and reads more expensive, as they need to go to more machines.\nNote that inconsistency may still occur: some machines that acknowledged the write can then die, and then the new majority may not include any machine with that write. Also, the partial failure scenario of synchronous replication can still occur here.\nDealing with conflicts\nAccepting writes in more than one machine at the same time means they can contradict each other. What happens if one machine accepts foo=42 while concurrently another machine accepts foo=13? Eventually, all machines in the system will be presented with both writes. What should they do?\nLast write wins\nThe easiest approach is to not deal with the conflict at all: make some choice between two conflicting writes and discard the other. This choice is made in all machines in the system, and needs to be deterministic so that the system keeps being eventually consistent, ie. machines don't contradict each other in the long run.\nThe usual way to choose one write over the other is that writes are tagged with the time they were first processed. Then, each node just chooses the write that seems to have happened more recently.\nNote that, as clocks aren't perfectly synchronized between machines, this may not actually be the case; but, even if it was, we could very easily be losing writes.\nConsider a counter that starts at zero. If the system receives T1: counter=1 (T1, T2, etc., being the time tag), then some client reads this and increases the counter by writing T2: counter=2, then all is fine. But if the system receives T1: counter=1, and concurrently some client reads the counter and sees counter=0, and then attempts to increase the counter by writing T2: counter=1, then the final state that will eventually be chosen by all machines is T2: counter=1. We have lost an increase.\nRead repair\nAnother technique is that, on noticing conflicting writes, store both, and let clients that read the data later perform a read repair by clarifying which final value should be kept, following whatever logic they choose.\nBut how can we detect conflicting writes?\nIn the example above, if a client sends T1: counter=1 and another client sends T2: counter=1, we know that there's a conflict: we have two increases, but the second client didn't take into account the first, concurrent increase. However, if we see T1: counter=1 and T2: counter=2, then there's no conflict: the final value of the counter coincides with the amount of increases performed, so the second client must have seen the T1: counter=1, and derived T2: counter=2 from it.\nThe trick is to tag each write with the version they're based on. There are several ways of doing this with different properties, but they broadly called logical clocks. See Why Logical Clocks are Easy if you're interested in details.\nIn the example above, in the conflicting scenario, the database would store both T1: counter=1 and T2: counter=1. When a client then reads the counter, it will be presented with both values. It can then merge them with a logic that makes sense; in this case, it can add their values to get a total count of T3: counter=2. This will be sent back to the database, which can then discard the conflicting values and store the merged value instead.\nCRDTs\nCRDT stands for Conflict-free Replicated Data Type. Those are types on which all operations are:\n\nCommutative.\nAssociative.\nIdempotent.\n\nThis means that processing any number of writes to the same CRDT yields the same result, no matter in which order they're applied, or even how many times each of them is performed.\nA set to which you can only add items is a trivial example of a CRDT. But there are others, for many useful scenarios.\nCRDTs have the additional nice property of being idempotent, which is a property that many databases just sweep under the rug but that we've seen how important it is.\nLinearizability: consistent-first robustness\nThere are leaderless systems that act as if they were a single machine with at all times, even if some machines fail.\nThis property of a whole distributed system acting as a single machine that processes operations one after another and keeps the data consistent between one operation and the next is called linearizability.\nIn practice, this is achieved with databases that achieve consensus. ZooKeeper, etcd and Consul are examples of such databases.\nThe downside is that such systems are usually very slow, and can't process that many writes per second. But for data that is small, changes not that frequently and is critical to keep fully consistent, linearizability is usually worth it.\nThis is an active area of research, however, and recently more databases are appearing with this or slightly lower consistency guarantees while still being distributed, fault-tolerant, and fast. Look into Spanner, FoundationDB and CockroachDB as examples of such databases.\nDurability vs. latency\nThe ability to not lose data once you've acknowledged as written is called durability.\nRoughly speaking, techniques that increase durability also increase latency. Making data durable means saving it deeper, in more reliable places, that will survive a reboot or even a whole disk failure.\nThere are systems that optimize for latency rather than durability. That's what caches usually do, for example: since the data they store is also stored (durably) somewhere else, or it can be recomputed, or we can afford to just lose it, they don't bother storing it in disk: they keep it in memory, which is way faster to access than the disk.\nPartitioning\nAs you can imagine, storing data gets hard as a system gets more users. You get:\n\nMore requests per second.\nMore volume of data: queries need to search more data to get a result.\nData may no longer fit in a single disk.\nReplicas may no longer be able to keep up with the pace of writes.\n\nSooner or later, you will have to not just store the same data in several places (replication), but also put different data in different places (partitioning).\nThis reduces the load in each partition, effectively eliminating bottlenecks and single points of failure. It is key to achieve a scalable system.\nPartitioning by keeping separate databases\nThis is the easiest way to partition your data: just keep separate, completely independent databases.\nThe downside is that you can't make queries that search all your data.\nPartitioning a single database\nYou can also partition a single database, so that you're able to query the whole database. This usually is handled by the database system you're using.\nIndexing a partitioned database\nOften, we want to query data not by its primary key (IDs), but by other fields (name, some date, etc.).\nWe do this efficiently by declaring an index. An index makes queries efficient roughly by making an ordered list of data; then, a query doesn't need to search all documents/rows/objects, just those within the limits of what we're querying.\nKeeping an index in sync with the data is easy in a single partition, but things get more involved in a partitioned database. There are two main approaches.\nPartitioned index\nThe index, ie. the list, lives in its own machine. Each time a write occurs, an additional write needs to be performed to each of the affected indexes's machines to keep it updated.\nSlow writes, fast reads, as a query by an indexed field only needs to look up one machine.\nScatter-gather\nKeep partial indexes in the same partition in which the data lives.\nFast writes, slow reads, as a query by an indexed field needs to go to all partitions for their partial indexes, then merge their results.\n"},"002-distributed-data/03-doing-things-later.html":{"url":"002-distributed-data/03-doing-things-later.html","title":"Doing things later","keywords":"","body":"Doing things later\nEscaping the request\nSo far, everything we've done in our request handlers has been synchronous. When we receive a response to a request, we know the operations associated with it have either completed or timed out.\nWe've seen, however, how database systems support asynchronous replication. Because replicating each save to every database replica is expensive and error-prone, the database just acknowledges the save has been written to a single machine, or to a quorum of machines. The caller then just trusts the database system to do its best to replicate the save to all replicas at some point.\nIn a similar vein, we can also consider doing some of the operations initiated by a request asynchronously. That way, part of the work isn't constrained by the request.\nCode example\nfunction myRequestHandler(request, response) {\n  let [parameterA, parameterB] = extractParametersFromRequest(request);\n\n  getSomePartialResult(parameterA)\n    .then((partialResult) => {\n      let processedPartialResult = someProcessing(partialResult);\n\n     // Do things in parallel. Synchronous does not mean one thing at a time,\n     // it just means waiting for their results before responding.\n     return Promise.all([\n        parallelSubOperationA(processedPartialResult),\n        parallelSubOperationB(processedPartialResult, parameterB),\n      ]);\n    })\n    .then(([parallelResultA, parallelResultB]) => {\n      let combinedResult = combineParallelResultsSomehow(\n        parallelResultA,\n        parallelResultB,\n      );\n\n      doSomethingElse()\n        .then((somethingElse) => {\n          // Asynchronous!\n          // ... do something with somethingElse, maybe...\n        });\n\n      response.respondWith(combinedResult);\n\n      // Synchronicity ends _here_! Everything that we're not sure it has\n      // finished at this point is asynchronous.\n      // That includes also doSomethingElse(). We _initiated_ it before\n      // responding, but we didn't wait for it to finish.\n\n      doMoreStuff()\n        .then(() => {\n          // Also asynchronous!\n        });\n    });\n};\n\nWhy delay things?\nKnowing how to do something is easy. Knowing why to do something, and especially when to choose to do so as an alternative to other options, is usually the tricky part.\nAsync != later\nLet's first clarify something: doing something asynchronous doesn't imply doing it later. It just means not waiting for it to be finished. But it may actually finish before we respond to the request, or at a later time; we (from the perspective of the request handler) don't care.\nSo \"delay\" is not really the word we should be using.\nDecouple the client from a task's completion\nTo find out what exactly is the difference between sync and async, let's reverse the question. Why not do things asynchronously?\nThe answer boils down to simplicity. We could handle every request asynchronously. The response doesn't really need to include the result of the operations the request handler initiated; it could just confirm that they were initiated, and the client could eventually get the feedback in some other way.\nBut, in a request-response pattern of communication, we usually want the response to include some result-like information beyond just \"OK, I initiated a series of operations that will finish at some point\". If we do this, then the client is forced to retrieve the results of such operations from somewhere else.\nSo doing things synchronously is a reasonable default strategy if we think the client will be interested in an informative result. (Even if this result is just that sub-operations finished, successfully or not! Which, as we've seen, tells the client whether it should retry the operation.)\nBut doing things synchronously imposes something on the client: the client also needs to wait. In effect, we tightly couple the client process's lifetime with those of all the synchronous operations it performs. The client can't make progress until the request is responded, even if it's not really interested in the result of the operation.\nDoing things asynchronously is more complex. We could say that synchronicity is a layer of simplicity sugar built on top of an event-based asynchronous mess.\nBut it also doesn't force the participants in a request's lifetime (that is, the client and the server that handles the request) into waiting for all consequences of a request.\nOK, so we've transformed the question into: why and when should we choose the complex decoupling of async over the convenient coupling of sync?\nOptimize differently for different workloads\nA common use case is to decouple different kinds of workloads.\nBy keeping machines specialized in one kind of task, we can optimize it, and the configuration around it, for performing that task.\nA server thet receives requests from an arbitrary number of clients, such as an Internet-facing backend, should be specialized in serving requests. This is challenging enough on itself. If we keep request handling lightweight, we make the job of the backend easier.\nNot having to wait for the tasks it initiates is a net gain for the backend: it means it can finish handling a request sooner, which frees the resources spent in it sooner.\nDistributing jobs among workers\nIn the end, though, somebody needs to perform the tasks that the request is meant to initiate. How can we do that? We can use the job queue pattern.\nIn a job queue, we have the following components:\n\nThe job represents the task to be performed.\nThe worker is a process that performs a job.\nThe queue, where jobs wait to be performed.\nThe processes that put jobs in the queue, usually  request handlers.\nThe dispatcher is a process that continuously takes jobs from the queue and assigns them to workers, ensuring that the amount of workers at any given time is bounded. It is usually implemented as some amount of consumer processes that continuously attempt to take a job from the queue, and, if there is one, performs it, thus becoming a worker.\n\n\ngraph TD\n  r1[request] --> queue\n  r2[request] --> queue\n  r3[request] --> queue\n  r4[request] --> queue\n  r5[request] --> queue\n  r6[request] --> queue\n  r7[...] --> queue\n  queue --> dispatcher\n  dispatcher --> w1[worker]\n  dispatcher --> w2[worker]\n  dispatcher --> w3[worker]\n  dispatcher --> w4[worker]\n\n\nThis has the following properties:\n\nThe amount of workers performing jobs is bounded by some number.\nThe amount of active request handlers is independent of the amount of workers.\nThe queue:\nTends to grow as there are more requests.\nTends to shrink as there are more consumers.\nTends to shrink as workers are faster.\n\n\nThe latency (time from request to completion) of a job is proportional to the queue length.\n\nThe challenge, then, becomes preventing the queue from filling up.\nCode example\n// jobQueue is a queue in which we will put functions that, when called, do\n// some job.\nlet jobQueue = [];\n\n// consumeFromQueue takes a job from jobQueue, starts it, and when it finishes,\n// starts again. Note that it only performs a job at a time.\nfunction consumeFromQueue() {\n  const startJob = jobQueue.shift(); // Dequeue first job.\n\n  if (startJob !== undefined) {\n    // If there is a job, do it. This then becomes a worker process.\n    startJob()\n      .then(() => consumeFromQueue()); // Consume again!\n  } else {\n    // If there isn't a job, try again asynchronously; next time there might be.\n    setTimeout(consumeFromQueue, 0);\n  }\n}\n\n// Start a _fixed_ number of consumers. This means we'll have a maximum of\n// numConsumers jobs underway at any time. This way, we make sure we don't\n// devote too many resources to performing the jobs. The only thing that will\n// grow proportionally to the amount of jobs is the length of jobQueue, and the\n// time it takes for jobs to be started since they're added by the request\n// handler.\nfor (let i = 0; i  {\n    return doSlowThing(parameters);\n  });\n\n  response.respondWith(okOrSomethingLikeThat);\n}\n\nMove latency to the background\nThis is a common scenario which is related to the previous one.\nMaybe we're not really worried about the resources an operation may consume, but for some reason or another the latency of the operation may increase.\nIf we do the operation synchronously, then the client is affected by this latency increase. But if we do it asynchronously, someone is affected by this latency, but not the client, or not directly, at least. Thus, we move this latency to the background.\nDecouple backends from the tasks to be performed\nWhat if the backend doesn't know everything that needs to happen with a request?\nThis is a matter of separation of concerns that has more to do with event-based systems than with asynchronicity.\nEvent-based system\nIn an event-based system we find three components:\n\nThe events, pieces of data to be transmitted.\nThe emitters, processes that emit events.\nThe listeners, processes to be activated or created when an event is emitted.\nThe dispatcher, the procedure that, whenever an event is emitted, activates or creates listeners and let them access to the event data.\n\nThe advantage of event-based systems is that processes don't need to know about every consequence of a request. When something happens, you can do part of the associated work and then emit an event so that others can do other parts of the work you don't even know about. Doing more things then becomes a matter of adding more listeners to the event, without even touching the emitter.\nEvents and async\nIn theory, the dispatcher can be synchronous: when an event is emitted, the dispatch activates each listener, waits for all of them to finish, and only then the emitter can continue.\nBut it's more usual that the dispatcher is asynchronous. The emitter emits the event and immediately continues with its work.\nEvent-based systems and async are a good match, because, since the emitter doesn't know which kind of work the listeners will be performing with the event, it's also not interested in their results, since it doesn't even know which kind of results they might be.\nAn interesting use case for synchronous dispatchers is to notify clients of partial failure in the crash+retry approach to robust systems we've studied, but it's not really usual.\nKeeping things causal\nAsynchronicity makes it easier to fall into race conditions.\nRecall that a race condition occurs when there's a mismatch between our expectations about how two events can affect each other and the reality. (Here, an event just means something happening.)\nWhenever an event happens after another in the same process, there's a chance they're causally related, ie. that the first one affected the second one somehow. If this causality does exist, and we lose track of it, then that's a bug waiting to bite you.\nAsynchronicity leads itself to race conditions.\n\n\nWe can keep order in the same way TCP does: by numbering the on the emitter side, so the order can be reconstructed on the listener side.\nFrom sync to async and back to sync again\nWe said before that we can build synchronous systems on top of asynchronous systems. How so?\nIf the async operation emits an event when it's done, the initiator of the operation can first set a listener for such event.\nCode example\nfunction doAsynchronously(parameter) {\n  doSomethingWithParameter(parameter)\n    .then((result) => {\n      emit('gotResult', result);\n    });\n}\n\non('gotResult', (result) => {\n  doSomethingWithResult(result);\n});\n\ndoAsynchronously(42);\n\n// This looks kind of silly in JavaScript, but imagine the event dispatcher, the\n// caller of doAsynchronously and the performer of doSomethingWithParameter are\n// all on separate machines.\n\nClients won't retry async operations\nWe've seen how letting a single end client retry an operation when it times out or any level of the request handling either times out or crashes.\nBut if a client isn't waiting for acknowledgment of an operation, it's also not setting a timeout for it. It won't know if it succeeded or failed, so it can't retry it.\nIf you care that an async operation eventually succeeds, you need to set another kind of monitoring process that retries the operation.\nA database for requests\nWe've seen how user-level clients, such as browsers or phones, can't be trusted to retry failed operations. So how can we put in charge of reliably retrying instead?\nIf you can't afford to get stuck in partial failure, then the very first thing you need to do is to store the request in a persistent database.\nThis ensures that, if the process crashes afterwards, we don't forget that, since the user's client might have forgotten already (remember: it can't be trusted; state on it is not durable). Then, another process can take over retrying the request by reading this database.\nA kind of database that does all this for you is a message queue, also called message broker.\nAsync message brokers\nMessage brokers are typically async: the process of publishing a message is decoupled from the process of delivering it to consumers.\nThis means that they cannot propagate delivery errors to publishers, since the publishers don't wait for delivery.\nThere's no exactly-once\nA message queue can ensure that a message will be delivered to consumers:\n\nAt least once.\nAt most once.\n\nWe typically would prefer exactly-once delivery, but that's not possible: once delivered, we don't know if the consumer has seen it or processed it unless it tells us, so we either wait for confirmation and re-deliver if we don't get it (at-least-once) or don't wait for confirmation and risk losing the message (at-most-once, also called fire-and-forget).\nBy making message processing idempotent, at-least-once is guaranteed to have the same effects as exactly-once. Yes, this is nothing new.\nMessage queues typically guarantee at-least-once delivery. They keep messages stored durable until they have confirmation that they can safely delete them. If they don't get such confirmation, they retry the delivery until they do.\nHandling a message = handling a request\nFor all intents and purposes, handling a message delivery from an at-least-once message queue is the same as serving a request from a client. The message queue is making a request to you, and is expecting an acknowledgment back. You can follow the same let-it-crash strategy we've discussed in past chapters.\nMessage queues typically don't guarantee ordering\nSome of them guarantee order inside a topic or channel, but not if events come from different channels.\nYou typically need to guarantee order yourself to avoid race conditions. If you get an event with a different serial number than you expected, then you just reject it, and let the message queue deliver it again at some later time; maybe at that time you will have processed all previous messages in the right order, and can then process this one.\n"},"002-distributed-data/04-operation-oriented-databases.html":{"url":"002-distributed-data/04-operation-oriented-databases.html","title":"Operation-oriented databases","keywords":"","body":"Operation-oriented databases\nServers serving services\nAlthough there are many ways computer can communicate with each other, in the Web-oriented world we mostly deal with client-server relationships.\nIn this model, there is a service that the server provides and the client consumes.\nFor example, MongoDB provides a service to store your data while trying not to lose it too much. It does so through an API, which clients often interact with through a client library.\nIn our case, the backend exposes all the functionality the frontend needs to activate as a result of user interaction, usually through an API built on top of HTTP and/or WebSockets, as those are the technologies that can be used from web browsers.\nBut what is the backend exactly? Is it a single program? Is it a system of programs? Well, that's on us to design and implement. Let's see which choices we have, and their tradeoffs.\nThe monolithic backend\nThe no-brainer approach to building a backend is to design a system with the following components:\n\nGeneric services that handle some functionality for us: databases, mailers, file storage, reverse proxies, etc.\nA program that implements app-specific logic to handle requests from frontends.\nMaybe some peripheral programs that run periodically (cronjobs) or consume jobs from a message queue.\n\nThis is the monolith approach: you have a single, big program that knows how to do everything.\nA constellation of microservices\nThe thing is, successful software projects tend to grow:\n\nNew functionality needs to be added.\nMore existing functionality needs to be modified or extended.\nMore people are put to work on it.\nThey get more users and more load.\n\nAs time passes, and the project grows and grows, the friction required to grow in all those dimensions increases, mainly because things that ought to be independent end up affecting each other.\nMicroservices is about reducing that friction by:\n\nSplitting your backend's service in several.\nHave specialized programs for each one.\nHave them collaborate as a distributed system.\n\nHoping that:\n\nNew functionality is added as a new service, or as small changes to a small number of services.\nChanges affect a single service or only to a small number of services.\nTeams can focus on a single service or a handful of them, without getting affected by other teams working in other services.\nEach service is designed specifically for the kind of scale it needs to support, and the kind of mission they perform.\n\nThe three first points are more about development than actual production concerns, but the fourth its just a hard technical reality: parts of your application probably have different technical needs than others, and having them as separate programs makes it easier to provide them with the resources that fits them best.\nAre microservices worth the trouble? It seems so, because organizations tend to naturally move towards them.\nWhere to split?\nThe criteria you use to assign responsibilities to microservices is pretty important. If you get it wrong, you can end up negating most of the benefits of doing microservices in the first place; such scenarios are called distributed monolith.\nEntity-oriented\nThis is maybe the most obvious way of segregating responsibility, since it's the way code is usually split in a codebase.\nYou identify entities in your domain, such as User, Company, Car, Receipt and whatnot. And then you create a service for each.\nSplitting like this, by itself, is likely to get you into a distributed monolith scenario.\nProbably, each service has a database where it creates, reads, updates and deletes the entities they're in charge of managing, with all their fields. (This database may be shared among services, introducing even more coupling between them.)\nThe thing is, business logic tends to affect a lot of entities. For anything that needs to happen, you'll end up doing lots of requests to lots of services. Things get even worse if you need anything like a join: for example, retrieve a list of Users with their Companies.\nFurthermore, the logic will be moving around lots of data it's not actually interested in. A single operation interacts with only a subset of that data. And data that \"belongs to\" an entity (fields) tends to accrue over time.\nOperation-oriented\nIf we shift our approach to \"what we want to do with the data?\", things get much better.\nWith this approach, the data that is kept together is the data that an operation, or a bunch of closely-related operations, needs to use.\nThe services are then in charge of those operations, and rarely have to talk directly to other services, except to perform other operations as opposed to just to access some data.\nThis usually means that you no longer have a single, cohesive User, Company or Car in a database somewhere. Instead, the data about an entity is distributed, maybe duplicated, in several databases.\nThis also makes it easier to assign appropriate resources to each operation. Some fields of an entity may be updated several times per second, while others are updated very unusually or never. Maybe some operation is only concerned with data that is active right now (for example, a delivery tracking service of some sort), and thus it only needs small database for it without much partitioning, while another service deals with past data with a more appropriate database.\nAs always, those are general rules that shouldn't be applied blindly. Both entity-oriented and operation-oriented can be mixed up, depending on the use case. Having data about a single entity in several places presents challenges that the entity-oriented approach doesn't.\nCriticality-oriented\nAnother criteria to consider is: \"how important is to keep this service up?\".\nSeparating services by how critical they are makes it easier to focus resources on them.\nGetting data you're interested in through events\nWith a entity-oriented responsibility segregation, it's obvious how to get the data you need for an operation: you go to the entity's service, which holds all its data. But once you go the operation-oriented route, the data you're interested in may have been produced in any other operation-oriented service. How do you get access to it?\nIf every service that produces data (and updates to data) sends events, then every service interested in that data can listen to those events, take exactly what they want, and save that in their own database, in order to later do something with them when requested.\nConsider the delivery tracking example from above. Say you have the following use cases:\n\nA customer orders a delivery for a package with some dimensions and weight.\nA route through logistic centers is decided for every delivery.\nWhen a delivery reaches a logistic center or something, an operator scans it and a time and place update takes place.\nLogistic centers need to be paid for every package they handle, daily. Heavier and bigger packages cost more.\nFinally, the customer is charged money based on how long it took the package to reach the destination. (Faster is more expensive!)\nThe customer can see the list of deliveries it has made in the past.\n\nWe can create services for each one of those operations, and have them communicate through events.\n\nWhen a customer orders a delivery, a service validates it and emits a DeliveryOrdered event, by putting it in a message queue.\nAnother service, let's call it delivery-router, consumes DeliveryOrdered events, and, based on its origin and destination, goes through the list of available logistic centers to calculate a route, and then emits a DeliveryAssignedRoute event.\nWhenever somebody from the delivery company adds, updates or removes a logistic center, a LogisticCenterUpdated event is emitted. delivery-routes consumes such events, to keep its list of logistic centers updated. This events comes with lots of data about the logistic center (name of the company that operates it, tariffs, etc.), so delivery-routes only stores the relevant data: its location, maybe which kind of packages they can handle, etc.\nAnother service listens for DeliveryAssignedRoute events and notifies logistic centers about an incoming package.\nWhen an operator in a logistic center scans a package, a service handles that, validates it and sends a DeliveryReachedLogisticCenter event with the logistic center ID, the delivery ID, and the time.\nAnother service listens for DeliveryReachedLogisticCenter to decide how much it should pay a logistic center for a delivery. For this, it also needs the center's tariffs and the package's dimensions, so it also listens forLogisticCenterUpdated and DeliveryOrdered events, taking the data it needs.\nThe service that charges customers listens to DeliveryOrdered, (to know when a delivery starts), DeliveryAssignedRoute (to know which logistic center is the last) and DeliveryReachedLogisticCenter (to know when the last logistic center is reached). It then emits an invoice, and maybe calls an external service to do the payment. It emits a DeliveryCharged event.\nAnother service listens to all this, integrates the information, and arranges it so that it can be inspected later by customers in a web page.\n\nData consistency in times of microservices\nThe operation-oriented, event-based approach comes with a cost: events are often delivered asynchronously, so have to be very careful about how we handle events.\nThis often means that what is true in one service is not true in another service... yet. It will be in the future, when events propagate the data to all affected services. This is called eventual consistency. We must be careful to know how this affects our operations, and where we can and can't afford it.\nFor example, in order to validate a money transfer, we need to know the balance of the user's account right now. We can't afford the service that handles that to base that decision on old data.\nEvent sourcing\nIt is often desirable to have a single source of truth. When data is denormalized, we can get into a situation in which different versions of it contradict each other.\nData, ultimately, derives from events that create, update and delete it. Those events are unique, immutable, and either ordered by causal relationships or independent from each other, as we've seen.\nIf we store such events somewhere, we can later reconstruct the data they're supposed to produce. If a service becomes out-of-sync with the events as they happen due to some problem, we can \"replay\" those events from the events storage to regenerate a consistent view of the resulting data.\nThis technique is called event sourcing.\n"},"003-backends-in-the-wild/":{"url":"003-backends-in-the-wild/","title":"Backends in the wild","keywords":"","body":"Backends in the wild\nRobust backends recap\nWe're getting close now to completing our picture of how a robust backend looks. Let's quickly recap where we're at:\n\nAn operation timing out or getting a transient error means that the client doesn't know whether it has completed successfully.\nBy retrying until we get success confirmation, we ensure an operation eventually succeeds. But this is not free:\nOperations need to be made idempotent, so that successful operations observed as failed can be retried without unwanted effects.\nSince clients are usually not reliable, to really ensure success, we need to, which complicates the system.\n\n\nIt's crucial to establish a exhaustive and well-defined protocol in the form of an API that works as a contract between clients and servers.\nAll possible errors that the operations could produce must be fully defined by this protocol.\nThey must not expose irrelevant details to the client.\nThey must expose enough information for clients to handle them gracefully at the right level.\nAt the very least, application-level errors must be easily differentiated from transient errors due to system conditions.\n\n\nDetails from underlying protocols, such as TCP connection termination, should be gracefully handled and have well-defined effects.\nWhen extended, the changes to the API should avoid breaking clients of the previous version.\n\n\nThe let it crash systems design principle states that, since the system must be ready to handle timeouts and crashes anyway, we can simplify error handling in a system prone to partial failure of an operation by immediately crashing in all levels of the operation when an inner-level operation fails, and letting an outermost level that reliable monitorizes the operation handle all crashes gracefully.\nSince distributed systems are inherently concurrent, we must be on the lookout for race conditions by ensuring a well-defined order of operations.\nAtomic operations are operations that either succeed fully or not at all, as a single event, so no concurrent events can affect their outcome.\nTransactions is how we usually achieve atomicity in a database, but we must be very careful to choose the right isolation level to avoid assuming a more relaxed meaning of atomic.\n\n\nLocks are the most flexible way of avoiding race conditions, but they are not atomic, so they're prone to partial failure and deadlocks (two processes waiting on each other to release a lock).\n\n\nSince machines or disks can die at any time and data held on them can be lost, we must replicate the data in several machines/disks in order to make a durable system (a system that doesn't lose data).\nIt takes time for data to replicate, so in the meantime data can be inconsistent (two machines may contradict each other on what's the state of the system). You must choose the replication mechanism with the right consistency guarantees for your use case, taking its cost into account.\n\n\nWe can move part of the work into message queues to be done later.\nMessage queues can be made durable and usually retry failed deliveries, so we can use them to ensure an operation eventually succeeds.\nThey allow us to trade off queue length for other resources when requests rate grows.\nThey allow us to acknowledge requests as successful more quickly, but we must be careful to define that such success doesn't mean all the work has been already carried out.\n\n\nBy splitting a component of the system in several components, we can assign each of them the right resources to perform their work optimally.\nIn particular, we can split data in several databases, focused on the operations they must support, and keep them consistent through an event-based architecture.\n\n\n\nBackends meet the physical world\nThe main piece missing is that backends run in real machines with limited resources and under changing conditions.\nWe've talked about failure in a very broad sense: what to do when anything fails. But we've seen little about how these failures, and the mechanisms we put in place to resist them, interact with the environment our backends run on.\nWe'll see how a good relationship with a changing environment with limited resources is the crucial missing piece for not just working around problems, but also for being able to prevent them and, even more importantly, for stopping them from spreading so much that even our recovery mechanisms break.\n"},"003-backends-in-the-wild/01-computers-disappear.html":{"url":"003-backends-in-the-wild/01-computers-disappear.html","title":"Computers disappear","keywords":"","body":"Computers disappear\nDisposable computers in robust systems\nAs we've seen, there's no escape to the fact that computers die from time to time.\nA single computer dying may be a tragedy, especially if you didn't hit \"Save\" recently.

(Under this definition, a network may just comprise a single computer.)\nBoth when a computer dies and when it's on the other side of a partitioned network, to us, it looks like the computer disappears.\nNetwork partitions are tricky, because a part of the system thinking that a computer is dead when it isn't, and other parts of the system don't think the same, can have bad consequences.\nHigh availability = no single point of failure\nThe buzzword that you want to include in your CV is that you know how to build highly available systems.\nA system being available at some given time means that the services it is supposed to be offering can be offered. Availability is higher as more frequent those times are.\nA truly highly available system continues operating correctly under network partitions. The service it provides may get degraded somehow, but it still serves its purpose.\nThis is usually a spectrum: we rarely can make systems totally partition-tolerant. Under a total network partition, we give up communication, and some tasks just cannot be performed without communicating with other computers.\nAt the very least, we can ensure that we have no single point of failure. If any individual component or operation that fails makes your system unavailable, it means that you have a single point of failure.\nDetecting failure\nThe mechanisms we use to decide that a computer has disappeared, or, in other words, that it is unavailable, are called failure detectors.\nTimeouts\nWe should be very familiar for now with the most basic of failure detectors: the timeout. If, after enough time has passed, some message you're expecting from a computer hasn't arrived, then you decide it is unavailable.\nThis may be combined with a number of failed retries, to try to account for delayed or lost individual messages.\nHeartbeats\nWe've studied the concept of connections on top of unreliable networks. By keeping track of the order of each other's messages, they can detect out-of-order, duplicate and missing messages and pretend they're talking over a reliable medium.\nBut what if one of the computers loses track of such order, for example by dying? Then the connection is at least partially broken.\nThis will eventually be detected by a timeout when we want to send a new message to it and we don't get a delivery confirmation in time. Or maybe we get a connection failure response, such as a TCP RST message, instead of a confirmation.\nThe problem with that approach is that we don't detect a failure until we actually want to use the connection. If we had detected the failure before, we could have reacted to it sooner, when the connection was not in active use, and maybe the service wouldn't have been as degraded.\nAlso, in the meantime, maybe the other end has been trying to send us messages too, and, through a similar timeout detector, decided the connection was broken. All that time, the other end and you would be in disagreement about the health of the connection, so you wouldn't try to recover a working connection and you would be missing attempts to communicate with you until then.\nThink about a chat application: it would be a terrible experience if it seemed that you were connected and people could talk to you until you decided to talk to someone, only to notice the connection failing at that point. You could spend hours thinking nobody is talking to you, when maybe that's not the case.\nA solution to this is to periodically confirm with the other end that the connection is still in place, by sending messages and expecting confirmations with the sole purpose of reaffirming your belief. Those messages are called heartbeats.\nIf, after a stipulated time, you haven't received confirmations of such messages, or, on the other side, you haven't received any such messages, you immediately deem the connection broken.\nHealth checks\nThis is similar to heartbeats. While heartbeats usually are about connections, health checks usually involve a whole machine.\nIt works like this: a machine exposes an endpoint which others can request just for checking whether the machine is available, as opposed to actually performing an operation. Some monitor in another machine periodically calls this endpoint to get such confirmation. If this fails, then the machine is deemed unavailable.\nWhat should the health check request handler do? It depends. If you do too much, you make the checks more expensive, maybe even affecting your actual service, and less resilient to accidental failures, such as transient networking errors, that don't really make you unavailable. If you do too little, you may be reporting yourself as available when in reality you can't do anything useful.\nHealth checks are often performed by reverse proxies to know the available backends they can route requests to, as we'll see in the next section.\nWhat then? Failover\nOnce we've decided a computer is unavailable, what can we do about it?\nSince we can't direct requests to it anymore, what we can do is to send requests to another, similar computer instead. This process is called a failover.\nRedundancy\nMany processes in our system will be almost stateless. The data they hold is either short-lived, such as open connections, requests in flight, or can be computed or retrieved from some other process, usually a database.\nWhen this is the case, we can just have several instances of the same program running, and distribute requests to the service they provide among them. If any of them dies, then we stop directing requests at it, and direct them to any of the other instances instead.\nThis is usually achieved through a reverse proxy, such as HAProxy, Nginx, or Envoy.\nIt's a good idea to keep our programs stateless, and put data in systems that are designed specifically to store data: databases. Then, any number of stateless programs can connect to a single database.\nShadow followers\nIf we've got a good reason to make our program stateful, then we can't just route any given request to any random backend. Following some sharding criteria, we must direct requests to specific backends. We can assign a backend to a request based on session ID, user ID, source IP, or a similar token that spans several requests. Then, all the data associated with that token will be in its consistently assigned backend.\nEven for stateless services that randomly assign requests to backends, proxies do this at the connection level: messages inside a TCP connection will be sent to the backend that holds the connection open, In this case, the sharding token is the source and destination port of the connection.\nSo what happens if the backend assigned to some token disappears? We can't just randomly reroute its requests to another backend, since the data associated with the token won't be there.\nWhat we can do is to keep shadow followers: instead of a single backend for a token, we assign:\n\nA leader backend, that processes the requests in full.\nSome number of shadow followers that are notified somehow of the state changes of the leader, so that they can keep the same data in them.\n\nIn the case of failover, one of its shadow replicas are promoted to leadership. Since it has the same state as the previous leader, it can take over requests that were directed to it, almost as if nothing happened.\nThis is essentially what database replicas do, and, as we've seen, is pretty hard to do right, so it's better to leave this work to them if possible.\nShadow followers = stateful proxies\nA problem with this approach is that the proxy needs to keep state: it needs to know which backend, both leader and followers, it has assigned to each token.\nSo we've moved the problem one layer up: what if the proxy disappears? We can't have only a single proxy directing traffic, since that would become a single point of failure.\nAs you can guess, we need to set up several proxies, and direct traffic from all of those to the right backend, for each request.\nBut we can't really follow the leader-followers approach here and assign specific proxies to requests, because who appoints the leader? Another proxy? Then it would be proxies all the way down!\nThis outer-layer distribution of traffic ultimately happens through DNS:\n\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant client1\n  participant proxy1\n  participant DNS\n  participant proxy2\n  participant client2\n  client1 ->> DNS: get addresses for someservice.com\n  DNS ->> client1: 1.2.3.4, 5.6.7.8\n  client2 ->> DNS: get addresses for someservice.com\n  DNS ->> client2: 1.2.3.4, 5.6.7.8\n  Note left of client1: OK, I'll choose 1.2.3.4 (proxy1)\n  Note right of client2: OK, I'll choose 5.6.7.8 (proxy2)\n  client1 ->> proxy1: request\n  client2 ->> proxy2: request\n\n\nBut, in this case, there's no leader: DNS distributes requests randomly among proxies. If we do nothing else, we end up in a situation in which each proxy assigns requests with the same sharding token to a different backend.\nThis is a kind of split-brain scenario. Keep reading!\nSplit-brain\nSometimes, there must be one, and only one, computer making decisions about something. Otherwise, they may contradict each other.\nThis is at odds with high availability: clearly, we cannot have just one computer assigned to some task. What if it disappears? Another computer must take over.\nBut we must still uphold the guarantee that only one computer at a time is doing the task. Otherwise, we end up in a situation called split-brain: the system has several decision-makers contradicting each other! We must avoid this, but how?\nLeadership election\nAppoint a leader through a consensus protocol, usually through something like ZooKeeper, etcd or Consul.\nA database with serializable transactions or atomic compare-and-swap support, or a distributed lock, or even quorum reads in a leaderless database, might be good enough, though.\nDon't outlive your leadership\nWhen you're a leader, you must be really sure that you're still the leader before making sensitive decisions.\nJust because you're alive and you were appointed leader in the past doesn't mean that you still are.\nThe sad part is, this is mostly impossible to do. Between the moment we confirm that we're still leader and we actually do what leaders do, an indeterminate amount of time may have passed, even if you do it right after checking, and others may have dismissed you from leadership.\nTo really avoid split-brain, in the general case, we must let go of high availability: decisions need to go through a single point of failure of some kind. But it's very rare that we need these extreme amounts of consistency. We probably can live with some level of split-brain risk.\n"},"003-backends-in-the-wild/02-deploying.html":{"url":"003-backends-in-the-wild/02-deploying.html","title":"Deploying","keywords":"","body":"Deploying\nWhen programs fly the nest\nThe time comes for your little backend to go out there and serve a real service.\nAs you probably can imagine, running a distributed system in production is quite different from running it on your machine.\nThe basics are the same: programs running on computers on some Unix-like operating system (Linux, unless you have a picky sysadmin or very specific needs), connected to the Internet. However, the operational requirements wildly vary.\nLet's see everything we want our production infrastructure to provide, and how to get there.\n12-factor apps\nFirst of all, your code needs to be adaptable to the environment. While developing, maybe you've been hardcoding URLs and file paths. Maybe you've been listening to whatever port directly. That's not going to fly now.\n12-factor is a common set of conventions for designing programs to run in modern infrastructure. As with any set of good practices, it's a guideline rather than holy scripture.\nThe Web page is actually well-written and should be approachable to newcomers. Go and take a good look before continuing. As always, ask your mentor for help!\nVersions coexisting for a while\nWhen you deploy a new version of a service, the new version will coexist with the old one for some time.\nGraceful deploys\nTo keep service disruption to a minimum, a deploy happens in stages:\n\nA new process is started with the new version of the code.\nWe wait for the service to report itself as available, often through health checks.\nWe start routing new requests to the new process.\nWe stop routing new requests to the old process.\nWe wait for ongoing requests to the old process to finish by themselves for some time, and then start closing them in a gradual, controlled manner (graceful shutdown).\nThe old process stops, or is forcibly stopped.\nRepeat for all instances we want to replace with the new version.\n\nIf we don't follow this exact order, there will be intervals in which requests will arrive to unavailable services.\nClients won't use the new API (yet)\nSo requests from clients will, for a small interval of time, arrive at both the old version and the new version of the code.\nEven when only the new version is left running, clients will still be consuming the same API, so the new version must support it. As we've seen, your changes must be backwards-compatible.\nThe full deprecation path\nSay we have version A in production, both in clients and servers, and we want to replace it with version B.\n\nDeploy a new version of the server that serves both APIs A and B.\nRelease a new version of the client that only consumes API B.\nWait until no clients of A are left, or until you're satisfied you can break all old clients left. (This might take years or even never happen.)\nRelease a new version of the server that only serves API B.\n\nData migrations\nAPIs aren't the only thing that changes. The code handling saving and retrieving data from a database changes too, in a similar manner.\nWhen you deploy a new version of your service, the stored data won't magically change at the same time to adapt to your new code. Instead, your new code must be compatible with existing data.\nMaking breaking changes will involve an intermediate stage in which you retrieve data in both the old and new versions, whatever exists, and store it in the new version. Eventually, no data still on the old version will exist, and you'll be able to delete code that handles it.\nStaging environments\nBefore facing the public, you probably want to put your backend in an environment that resembles production as much as possible, but doesn't actually affect production. This will give you some extra confidence that your code will actually work.\nSuch an environment is usually called staging or preproduction (different people mean different things with those terms).\nLoad testing\nA production-like environment is also a good place to check what happens when load increases.\nYou can change load factors (requests per second here and there, request size, entropy (how similar requests are to each other, for a relevant definition of similar), etc.) and also resource allocations independently or in coordination to see how different configurations affect the different parts of your system.\nTesting in production\nWhether you like or not, ultimately your changes will be tested in production.\nThe production environment can display some combination of factors that your testing pipeline hasn't anticipated that causes your changes to break.\nSince this is always a possibility, you need to plan for it and try to reduce service impact in such scenarios. And, since you have to support this anyway, you can actually take advantage from it and not fret that much over your testing pipeline.\nSending a canary down the coal mine\nA canary release is a first, limited, especially monitored release of your changes so that they only handle a small portion of the incoming requests.\nThis usually means just deploy a few, or even a single, instance of the new version, and let load balancers direct a proportional amount of traffic to it.\nIf you observe failures related to the canary, you kill the canary (if it's still alive) and, based on the data you've gathered from your monitoring, fix your changes and try again.\nOtherwise, you gradually deploy to handle more and more of the requests, until the release is complete.\nWe will discuss at length how to observe such failures in future chapters.\nRolling back bad releases\nEven if your changes passed the canary phase, an actual release that starts processes that handles more and more traffic, and replaces more and more of the old processes, can unleash failures due to the increasingly intense environment your changes live in.\nWhen this happens, you need to be able to quickly deploy the previous version, to fall back to a (hopefully) stable state.\nThis process is called a rollback or a revert.\nAssigning computing resources\nOur programs happen to run in actual computers. Actual computers cost money, so ideally we want to assign computer resources to the different parts of your system optimally: enough to handle the amount of traffic you expect, but not much more than that.\nLoad testing and observing how production behaves can help you decide which are those optimal resources for each of your system components.\nSchedulers\nThe art of assigning limited resources to processes with particular demands is called scheduling.\nSystems such as Nomad and Kubernetes implement schedulers that take your requirements about the resources you need the and assign them to the available computing resources, automatically deploying then in the computers they decide.\nSchedulers are often in charge also of monitoring the health of each process, so that a process that dies is automatically replaced.\nNo single computer, no single datacenter\nHere are two facts of life:\n\nA computer that dies takes down all processes running on it.\nA datacenter that dies takes down all computers running on it.\n\nThankfully, the recipe for being robust in both scenarios is simple: don't put all your eggs in the same basket.\nYou should have some replicas or redundant instances of each of your backend services on different datacenters, and, within a datacenter, on different computers.\nThe problem is, communicating from one datacenter to another comes with big latencies, so you probably want to sacrifice some consistency there by only communicating the essential and doing so asynchronously when possible.\nFinding others in a changing environment\nSo your scheduler will decide where it will actually run your processes. In fact, it will probably run them itself, taking charge of starting and stopping them, passing configuration to them, etc. It needs to decide which resources to allocate for a process, so it makes sense that it also takes care of actually running the process within its designated resources.\nThis means that you really can't predict which address any given process will have. How do you get processes to communicate? After all, you're trying to deploy a distributed system!\nThis problem is called service discovery, and it involves some number of registries. For example:\n\nRedundant backends offering the same service need to register with their reverse proxy/load balancer.\nReverse proxies for a service need to register in some service registry, so that requests to that service reach them.\nThe outermost layer needs to listen to traffic directed at the IP addresses listed in the public DNS records.\n\nAdjusting scale\nFor a variety of reasons, traffic goes up and down. You should adjust available resources accordingly.\nObservations from production and load testing will help you predict how resource requirements change as different traffic patterns change.\nAuto-scaling\nCloud providers let you order and dispose of computing resources on-demand, and often do so automatically by monitoring your performance.\nA note about deploying microservices\nIn previous chapters we talked about some of the advantages that a microservices architecture is supposed to provide. We didn't really discuss its drawbacks.\nWell, here they are: as the number of heterogeneous moving parts increase, we need to do more of the stuff presented in this chapter. It's hard to avoid that operating tens or hundreds or microservices usually result in a complexity explosion and quickly becomes a challenge. There's not really enough tooling in place to handle all this easily, and it remains an unsolved problem.\n"},"003-backends-in-the-wild/03-memory-isnt-infinite.html":{"url":"003-backends-in-the-wild/03-memory-isnt-infinite.html","title":"Memory isn't infinite","keywords":"","body":"Memory isn't infinite\nWork takes memory for some time\nIt shouldn't come as a surprise that doing computing work involves allocating memory resources to it for some time.\nThis simple fact is often ignored. This would be a reasonable course of action if memory and time were infinite resources. Alas, they aren't!\nGracefully managing overloaded servers is a crucial missing piece in our magnificent strategy for designing robust systems.\nAs often happens, libraries, frameworks and tools make it absurdly convoluted to get this right. So you need to take the techniques we're going to learn to heart, and conscientiously apply them whenever you see a chance worth of them.\nThe bottleneck path to unavailability\nConsider a system like this:\n\ngraph LR\n  a[\"0/âˆž serving, +0.1 s/req\"] --> b[\"0/3 serving, 0 queued, +1 s/req\"]\n\n\nThe component at the left just takes requests and passes them to its dependency on the right.\nThe dependency on the right takes 1 second to serve a request, but it can only serve 3 requests at a time: additional concurrent requests are queued. As ongoing requests finish, the oldest requests in the queue are served.\nThe backend on the left adds 0.1 seconds per request to whatever its dependency takes to respond.\nIt's easy to see that this setup will happily serve requests at 1.1 seconds per request, as long as we don't have more than three concurrent requests at any time.\nMeanwhile, we say that the component at the left can handle any number of concurrent requests. This isn't realistic, but it doesn't matter: since every request must go through the dependency, the only thing that matters is whether this dependency is faster than you or not.\nWhen a dependency of yours is less performant than you, it becomes a bottleneck: even if your part of the work is pretty fast, you're still slow, because a bottleneck is slow.\nBottlenecks at capacity â†’ queued requests\nBut what happens if we go over that limit?\nSuppose that requests reach the bottleneck at t+0.3, t+0.4, t+0.6 and t+0.8.\nThe first three requests will be responded after 1 s each, at t+1.3, t+1.4 and t+1.6 respectively. But what about the fourth? The fourth won't be responded at t+1.8, but at t+2.3, taking 1.5 s instead of 1 s. How so?\n\nWhen it arrives at 0.8 s, the bottleneck will have three already. The bottleneck can't start working on the request yet, since it's at capacity: it is added to the queue.\nOnly when the first requests is responded, at t+1.3, will the component start working on the fourth request.\nThat takes a second, so t+1.3 + 1 s = t+2.3.\n\nNote that this bottleneck doesn't need to be in an external service. It can be a CPU-intensive task, a shared connection to a database, or anything else that takes longer than you.\nQueued requests â†’ higher response latencies\nAs more requests are queued, the latency of new requests increase: since they're taken from the queue later, and started later, they're also responded later.\nNote that it only takes a sustained rate of >3 req/s to cause the queue to keep growing and growing. Even 3.00001 req/s will cause the queue to grow. Latencies will grow proportionally.\nHigher response latencies â†’ more timeouts\nEventually, latencies will grow so much that the end clients will start timing out, resulting in failed requests.\nCanceling such requests helps, as those requests can be removed immediately from the queue, but then the bottleneck will successfully process only the maximum amount of requests per second that keeps the slowest requests just under the client's timeout period.\nMore timeouts â†’ more retries\nAs we've learned, if we really want an operation to succeed, after a timeout, we retry it.\nBut if we do this, we accumulate:\n\nThe rate of new requests per second.\nThe rate of retried requests per second.\n\nJust by following this strategy, the requests rate that our system is subjected to quickly skyrockets! Since we're already at capacity, incoming requests just fail, so new requests, retries, retries of retries, retries of retries of retries, etc. just accumulate, and we receive more and more requests per second.\nAt this point, the system is fully unavailable: none or almost none of the requests arriving to it are successfully served. They all just time out.\nMore retries â†’ more queued requests\nThis vicious circle, of course, makes the requests queue grow at exponentially increasing speed.\nEnough queued requests â†’ memory exhaustion\nEventually, we just won't have enough space for more queued requests. What happens then? It boils down to two options:\n\nIncoming requests are dropped.\nIn-flight requests are dropped, probably by crashing the whole process (OOM, Out Of Memory: the operating system starts killing processes).\n\nIt doesn't matter much: eventually we arrive at the same situation.\nThe unbounded concurrency path to unavailability\nOK, that's assuming there's some bottleneck that consumes requests at a slower pace than requests arrive to it. What if there isn't? What if handling a request takes 0.1 s, or even 0.0001 s, and there's no limit (for the sake of argument) to the amount of concurrent requests after which we enqueue requests?\nEnough request handlers â†’ memory exhaustion\nSo imagine that:\n\nHandling a request takes 2 KB of memory.\nHandling a request takes 0.0001 s.\nThe machine has 24 GB of memory.\n\nIt takes 24 GB / 2 KB = 12000 concurrent requests to run out of memory.\nTo create enough concurrent request handlers to fill that memory, we need to make 12000 requests in under 0.0001 s, which is 120 Mreq/s. Which is big, but not infinite!\nThe point is that, no matter how fast a request is handled, how little memory it consumes, or how much memory a machine has, there's some number of concurrent requests that results in memory exhaustion, which results in requests dropped, and thus, unavailability.\nNeedless to say, continuously retrying all those requests won't make things better.\nIncreasing requests/second by async queuing â†’ queue exhaustion\nA first approach to reduce the impact of bottlenecks is to put the bottleneck behind an async message queue.\nReturning to our example above, and assuming that publishing to the message queue is, say, 0.2 s, we effectively serve each request at 0.3 s. The actual work will take just as above, even more taking into account the message enqueueing and dequeuing overhead, but there won't be clients waiting for it, timing out, retrying, and making things worse.\nThis is useful if the request rate goes over our hard limit of 3 req/s for some time, then wears off and goes under it: the queue will fill for that interval, but then slowly decreases as the bottleneck catches up. Thus, queuing work is useful to resist temporary load spikes.\nBut if the request rate is constantly above our hard limit of 3 req/s, then the queue will eventually be exhausted too, and the message broker will be forced to reject new publishes, resulting again in unavailability, retries piling up, etc.\nBackpressure\nIn face of all this, the rule for letting an overloaded system recover is rather simple:\n\nMake fewer requests to an unavailable system, not more.\n\nForcibly reducing the requests per second that reach a system lets its bottleneck catch up with pending work, emptying queues. We then give the system operators the chance of making the bottleneck faster by scaling, or maybe just let the bottleneck solve itself if it was due to some temporary condition.\nDesigning clients for reducing load on unavailable services is called backpressure.\nImplementing backpressure is probably the most ignored robustness mechanism out there, but it's absolutely crucial and not even hard to do.\nExponential backoff\nWe've repeated again and again that retrying is good, but we've seen it backfire badly when systems are overloaded. Should we give retries up then?\nNot necessarily. We've left open the question of when we should retry an operation. Should we wait some time? How much?\nSay we choose to retry a failed operation after 5 seconds. If we're consistently overloaded by the incoming request rate, that still means that retries will keep piling up, and the overall request rate, aggregating new requests, retries, retries of retries, etc. will still grow. Retrying each 30 seconds instead just makes this growth slower.\nThe solution is beautiful in its mathematical elegance: cancel out this tendency to grow by retrying any given operation less often over time.\nAs a result, retries will arrive evenly distributed in time. As the period of unavailability grows, retries don't pile up; instead, they will arrive over a proportionally growing period of time, but at a fixed rate.\nThis breaks the vicious circle and gives the system a chance to catch up with the new request rate requirements so that eventually the system is reliably available again.\nCircuit breaker\nAn even more radical and effective way of reducing load to an unavailable system is to prevent all operations for some time on a service when one operation, or a few operations in a row, fails. During that period, way say that the circuit is broken.\nWhile exponential backoff of retries of individual operations keeps the request rate to the unavailable service constant, circuit breakers reduce the request rate dramatically, to almost zero. This makes it so much easier for bottlenecks to recover quickly.\nSo, for how long should we keep the circuit broken? If we choose a big interval, we can often be pessimistically preventing operations while the service is actually available again. But if we choose a small interval, we make more requests to a service that may still be unavailable.\nChoosing small interval is probably good enough: in practice, no system will get overloaded by receiving, say, 3 requests per second, which gives an interval of 0.3 s.\nWe can combine both approaches by implementing some exponential back off. But we must be careful to cap it at some reasonable interval, say 3-5 seconds. Otherwise, we might spend really long periods of time preventing requests that is back to normal.\nHealth as a spectrum\nAnother way of implementing backpressure is making health checks more nuanced: instead if responding \"yes, I'm available\" or \"nope, I can't serve\", respond with some measurement of the level of overload in the server. (A high percentile of the latencies over a period is a good metric.)\nThe load balancer can then forward fewer requests to slower backends, making it easier on them to recover.\nOf course, this only helps when the overload is asymmetric. It won't help if, as it's often the case, all backends of a service are equally overloaded since they depend on the same bottleneck.\nIn the end, the bottleneck must be fixed\nBackpressure is great for avoiding making the problem worse, but, by itself, won't make the problem disappear: we're receiving more requests that our system supports.\nThis points to an insufficient resource allocation. If it's due to some transient failure somewhere, the resources may come back by themselves, but if we are just getting more traffic that we've designed for, then we must scale up the system.\n"},"003-backends-in-the-wild/06-observability.html":{"url":"003-backends-in-the-wild/06-observability.html","title":"Observability","keywords":"","body":"Observability\nWhy we need to observe\nAs we've seen, our services and our infrastructure are more distributed and ephemeral day by day. Our systems are more advanced and every one have different reliability targets, requirements and guarantees. All the cloud services (and custom services if configured properly) provides a robust abstraction over network and hardware failures, which means that as software developers we must ensure that our applications are good enough to survive with that networking and scheduling abstractions. We need to gain visibility into the behavior of our applications.\nTraditionally the systems engineers had some dashboards with operational monitoring and alerting (CPU/Memory/...), and that was enough to know if the application was going well or no. Nowadays with distributed systems we need to go further in order to ensure the correct behavior of our system. That's Observability, it's more than logs, metrics and traces. In the most abstract and complete way, observability is a property of a system that has been designed, built, tested, deployed, operated, monitored, maintained and evolved in acknowledgment of this facts:\n\nNo complex system is ever fully healthy\nDistributed Systems are pathologically unpredictable\nIt's impossible to predict the myriad states of partial failure the parts of the system might end up\nFailure needs to be embraced in every phase: system design, implementation, testing, deploying and operation\nEase of debugging is a cornerstone for the maintenance and evolution of robust systems\n\nMonitoring and Observability\nObservability is not a substitute to monitoring, observability is a superset of monitoring, which means that to achieve observability you will need good monitoring, but you will need more things.\nWe'll focus on some techniques of observability, but there are many more, observability it's more a team mindset than a set of tools or techniques. All the system has to be designed with some concepts in mind:\n\nA system need to be prepared to be tested in a realistic manner.\nA system can be deployed gradually and the roll-back/roll-forward are easy, fast and can be automatic\nA system must be able to report data points about his health and behavior.\n\nMonitoring\nMonitoring is the way to report the overall health of the system and create alerts. The monitorized data can be very different, RAM/CPU used, requests/s, latency, DNS lookup, etc. The key factor of monitoring is that is predictable (you can assume that if some metric goes higher than X you have a problem), it affects the end users, and needs human intervention as soon as possible.\nThere are two general types of monitoring (You can learn more here):\n\nBlackbox monitoring. You observe the systems from the outside, this is the most common monitoring done in the companies, and it refers to metrics like CPU, disk space, memory, load averages, etc.\nWhitebox monitoring. You observe the applications running instead of the systems, with distributed systems is more common. It can be metrics like SQL queries running, number of users in an application, requests with error or requests with success, etc.\n\nEven though whitebox monitoring is used more and more, we can't forget blackbox monitoring, specially when you depend of external services (like a database hosted by a third party company) that you can only do blackbox monitoring.\nAlerting\nMonitoring data must provide a global view of the health of a distributed system exposing high-level metrics over time across all components (load balancers, caches, databases, services). An alert must have some monitoring data attached with the ability to drill down into components and systems to diagnose the scopes and the nature of the fault.\nAdditionally, in the occurrence of an alert, the monitoring data should be able to provide visibility into the impart of the failure and the effect of any fix deployed. Also, for the best on-call experience, all alerts need to be actionable, which means that you have to be able to know what to do with the alert data.\nThere are two set of metrics for monitoring purposes:\n\nUSE methodology analyses the system performance. The metrics will be used for measuring utilization, saturation and errors or system resources, eg: memory, CPU, divide errors, queue length.\nRED methodology analyses the applications. This method calls for monitoring the request rate, error rate and duration of request. Really necessary for monitoring request-driven applications.\n\nCoding and testing in production\nAs we've seen, observability is a state of mind where the whole system has been developed with it in mind, and one important point in this is not rely only on pre-production testing. It's important, but being able to test in production elevates the resilience of your code and your observability. In order to achieve that state, the whole team will need to code and test for failure, instead of coding for success.\nThere are three main things to write code for failure:\nOperational semantics of the application\nThe developer must be aware of the operational semantics of the application, for example:\n\nHow the service will be deployed\nHow an application handles signals\nHow it registers with service discovery\nHow it discovers upstreams\nHow graceful the restarts will be\nHow the configuration will be received\nThe concurrency model\n...\n\nThere are many operational questions that nowadays the platform abstract from the developer, and it's important to be aware of all of them.\nOperational characteristics of the dependencies\nYou need to know, not only your operational characteristics, but the ones of your dependencies, so you are able to know if you want to use the default values of the dependencies or override it with your own value.\n\nHow your cache library/service will work\nThe configuration of your database library, the connection pool size, timeouts, etc\n\nDebuggable code\nIf your code is debuggable, you will be able to ask questions to your application when you are in trouble. For this you'll need to understand the instrumentation of choice (metrics, logs, exception traces, ...) and the pros/cons. With that knowledge, being able to pick the best combination of instrumentation for your service requirements. It seems an easy task, but it's not easy at all.\nTesting for failure\nWriting unit tests is important, but you will need to do more testing in order to improve your confidence in the application. At the end, unit testing only shows the happy path of your scope (and probably heavily mocked). But we know that when the complexity of the systems grows, it will fail in more complex ways that you can't predict.\nLately more and more ways of testing in production have appeared, and many of them will need you to write your application in order to ease that task.\nHere are the phases of testing, as you can see there are a myriad of tests.\n\nTesting in production is hard, and not eliminate all the system failures, but it will build confidence in the reliability of complex distributed systems\nLogging\nAn event log is an immutable, timestamped record of events that happened over time. There are three main forms of event logs:\n\nPlain-text, the most common format of logs, this is just free text\n\n[2018-11-14T18:50:18.003Z]  INFO: hello/40026 on rock.local: hi ironhack\n\nStructured, in recent days it's the beloved way to go, usually the format is JSON\n\n{\n    \"time\": \"2018-11-14T18:50:18.003Z\",\n    \"level\": \"info\",\n    \"msg\": \"hi ironhack\",\n    \"hostname\": \"rock.local\",\n    \"name\": \"hello\",\n    \"pid\": 40026\n}\n\n\nBinary, instead of an structured text format, is an structured binary format, like Protobuf or MySQL's binlog.\n\nThe logs are important, because it's the application diary of all the activity, if the logs are detailed we can investigate when we have a bug or some error.\nLog events are the easiest observability key point to generate, since they are just text or JSON that the application generates and emit, and most languages have logging frameworks and libraries. In the logs you can add all the metadata you want, which provides a highly granular information with rich local context. Even more, if you use structured logging and some processor like ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) you will find much more data and relations in your event logs.\nThe main problem of logs is the performance, due to that most of the default or de-facto libraries are bad in performance. They are slow, write synchronously and/or have a big memory footprint. And, even with some really performant libraries, logging excessively has the capability to affect the application performance.\nEvent data can be used in more situations than debugging, it's a great source of analytics data. The same event logs processed by a server can answer some business questions like \"Filter the countries from where users viewed this page less than 100 times\", meanwhile for debugging the same data can answer questions like \"Show page loads from Spain that took more than 10s to load\". The usual way to be able to do this kind of queries is to treat your event data like any other streaming data, processed by some indexing stores like Elasticsearch.\nMetrics\nMetrics are a numeric representation of data measured over intervals of time. They bring the power of mathematical modeling and predictions to the current and future system's behaviors.\nUnlike logging, metrics are mainly numeric representations, which are easily optimized for storage, processing and querying. This properties makes metrics perfectly suited to build dashboards with historical trends.\nClassic metric tools only had the metric name, timestamp and the metric value, which is limiting when you want to graph interactions between different applications in your distributed system. Modern metric tools such as Prometheus or newer versions of Graphite apart of the three classic values provides a way to assign labels to the metric.\nFor example, the metrics for the duration of endpoints of an API, in an classic way would look like:\n{\n    \"name\": \"get_estimation\",\n    \"date\": \"2018-11-14T18:50:18.003Z\",\n    \"value\": \"200\"\n}\n\nInstead, if the metric tools have labels support, you can have a generic metric for request, and add the granularity with labels:\n{\n    \"name\": \"request_duration\",\n    \"date\": \"2018-11-14T18:50:18.003Z\",\n    \"value\": \"200\",\n    \"labels\": {\n        \"method\": \"get\",\n        \"action\": \"estimation\",\n        \"environment\": \"production\",\n        \"code\": \"200\",\n        \"code_family\": \"2xx\"\n    }\n}\n\nThe advantages of metrics over logs is that transfer and storage has constant overhead. Unlike logs, with user traffic won't incur a significant increase in disk utilization, processing complexity, operational cost. The storage increases with more permutations of labels values but the client-side aggregation doesn't increase proportionally with user traffic.\nThe are some metric tools, like statsd, that works in push model, which means that it sends the data to the server, which can lead to an auto DDOS to the metrics server. Other metric tools, like Prometheus, use the pull model, where the metrics server knows of the applications that it needs to \"scrape\" and every few seconds (that can be configured) retrieves the aggregated metrics from the applications. This pull based metric servers allow them to use back-pressure on the clients when they are not working properly.\nThanks to the mathematical benefits, and that running queries against time-series databases is better on metrics that in some indexing storage for logs, it makes the metrics the tool best suited to trigger alerts.\nThe main drawback of metrics is that they are system scoped, it's really hard to understand anything cross-application. With labels you can mitigate this, with the increase of metric storage of course. You could add some request UUID as label to all the metrics, so you can trace easily the metrics of that query in the distributed system, but this can overwhelm time-series databases, and it will make the graphs and queries slow. All popular time-series databases suffer performance under high cardinality labeling.\nLogs and metrics are perfect for a single system, and it's enough to understand the performance and behaviour of individual systems, but they aren't sufficient to understand the lifetime of a request in a distributed systems, to achieve that we'll need one more technique.\nTracing\nA trace is a representation of a causally related distributed events that encode end to end request flow through a distributed systems.\nTraces are used to identify the amount of work done at each layer while preserving causality by using \"happens-before\" semantics.\nWhen a request begins, it's assigned a globally unique ID, which is propagated throughout the request path so every point of instrumentation will be able to enrich the metadata before passing around the ID when doing other requests. When the execution flow reaches the instrumented point a record is emitted with the metadata. With all that events with the unique ID and the metadata, we are able to construct the flow of execution based of the different events emitted in different parts of the system.\n\nHaving an understanding of the entire request cycle makes it possible to debug requests spanning to multiple services to identify the source of the increased latency.\nThere are many use-case for distributed tracing, primarily used for inter service dependency analysis, distributed profiling and debugging.\nThe most popular OpenTracing compliant solutions are Jaeger and Zipkin.\nAs you can imagine, adding distributed tracing retroactively in an existing infrastructure is really hard, every component in the path needs to be modified to propagate the tracing information. You can start adding it, and you will have big gaps where the tracing has not been added, which can be better than not having tracing at all, but some people think that this blind spots makes debugging even harder.\nThe second problem is that it's not enough to instrument your code, you need to instrument the libraries and frameworks that you use, which can be really hard sometimes.\nWhile tracing is difficult to implement, we've seen a rise in \"service meshes\", which makes almost effortless adding the tracing functionality. The service mesh most used by far is istio.\n"},"101-appendix-containers/":{"url":"101-appendix-containers/","title":"Containers","keywords":"","body":"Containers\nWe are going to take advantage of the container technology for this bootcamp, so we're going to explain briefly what they are and how to use them.\nModern operating systems allow to have multiple user-space instances, that look like real computers from the point of view of programs running in them. The difference between a program running in an ordinary operating system and a program running in a container is that the latter can only see a subset of the resources that are visible for the former, those assigned to the container.\nFor the bootcamp, we are mostly interested in the flexibility that containers offer. Since each container behaves as it's a different computer, we can simulate a complete distributed system locally, in our own computers.\nDocker\nDocker is one of the best known container system available and is the one we will use during the bootcamp.\nA docker system is composed of a daemon (dockerd) and a client (docker). The client communicates with the daemon that listens for commands. We will always interact through the client.\nDocker manages several different entities, we are interested in just two:\n\nA docker image, a template used to build docker containers.\nA docker container, which uses a docker image to build the actual isolated environment and run the applications.\nA docker registry, which is a (local or remote) repository for docker images.\n\nThe usual workflow while working with docker is:\n\nCreate an image or get one from a docker registry\nRun a container based on the image\nStop the container\n\nImage creation\nTo create an image first we have to define it.\nThis is usually done in a Dockerfile file.\nHere we can see an example of a simple node application image:\nFROM node:latest\nADD . /app\nWORKDIR /app\nRUN npm install\nCMD [\"node\", \"index.js\"]\n\nNow we can build the image with:\n$ docker build -t myapp:latest .\n\nmyapp is the name we tag the image with. This will be used to run a container based on this image.\nYou can see the available images with:\n$ docker images\n\nRun a container\nYou can run a container either using your own image as explained in the previous section, or some image available in some docker registry.\nFor example, the command to run a container based on the image built previously would be:\n$ docker run myapp\n\nTo run a container publicly available in a docker registry (for example, a mongodb image):\n$ docker run mongo\n\nIn this case, the docker command does two different things:\n\nDownload the image\nRun the container built from this image\n\nThe first step can also be done separately with:\n$ docker pull mongo\n\nDocker compose\nDocker provides an easy way to build, share and run containers, which is great.\nBut we are building distributed systems, and having to run each container manually becomes tedious fast.\nThere are several ways to approach such problem, we'll go with docker compose.\nDocker compose is a tool to define an run multi-container applications and will allow us to build the systems we will use in the exercises locally quite easily.\nTo define such multi-container system, a configuration file, in YAML format, is used.\nThe configuration file for the first exercise is as follows:\nversion: '3'\nservices:\n  exercise1:\n    build: .\n    ports:\n     - \"9001:9001\"\n  messageapp:\n    image: \"cabify/backend-bootcamp-messageapp:latest\"\n    ports:\n      - \"3000:3000\"\n\nThe configuration file is composed of:\n\nA configuration format version in the first line\nContainers definition in the rest of the file. There are two services:\nexercise1: A container that is built using the image described in Dockerfile in our current directory and will listen in port 9000.\nmessageapp: A container that is built using the image tagged with cabify/backend-bootcamp-messageapp:latest (which may be available either locally or in a docker registry), which will listen in port 3000.\n\n\n\nThis is just the basics of how to configure a multiple container system with docker compose, but it should give a quick overview of the idea. Check the references for more information.\nNow, we just need to build the system we have just described:\n$ docker-compose build\n\nand run it:\n$ docker-compose run\n\nThis will launch both services in containers as defined above.\nReferences\nWe have only covered the basics of containers, docker and docker compose.\nYou can take a look to the following resources for further information:\n\nDocker Get Started.\nThe firt 3 steps cover the same material seen here in more detail:\ndocker concepts and setup, buiding an example app with docker, and buiding a multi-container system with docker compose.\nDocker documentation The official docker documentation site.\nAwesome Linux Containers A big catalog with further resources.\n\n"},"102-appendix-good-practices/":{"url":"102-appendix-good-practices/","title":"Good Practices","keywords":"","body":"Good Practices\nSoftware Engineering is more than just writing code[1]. By Software Engineer, we don't mean a person with a degree in Computer Science. But one who looks at writing quality software as their profession.  Knowing how to program is not enough to make software engineering. There are several analogies that help us to understand this:\n\nEveryone can sing (especially in the shower), but if you have to throw a party you probably hire professional musicians.\nEveryone can cook. But when itâ€™s time to feed a lot of people we hire a Chef.\nEveryone can write, but it doesn't mean you are a novel author.\n\nSoftware is not different. You might know how to program and you might be able to code simple programs, but that's different from writting engineered programs. And one thing that characterizes a engineered program is the code quality.\nCode quality is subtle. There are some code constructions that could cause real troubles to the authors, and directly or indirectly also to the users. There are also some good practices that help to avoid such harmful constructions and improve the quality of our sofware. Along this appendix, we will describe some of them, divided in two different sections:\n\nGeneral good practices. Some general principles to write better sofware.\nDesign good practices. Good practices applied to the sofware design and software architecture.\n\nImportant disclaimer: this is about good practices. You should not interpret this as The Truth. It's a guide, a compendium of tricks and advices to make better software. Do not read it as a code of conduct. We expect you to apply your own criteria and think by yourself while coding.\n[1]: https://edgecoders.com/software-engineering-is-different-from-programming-b108c135af26 Samer Buna - Software Engineering is Different from Programming\n"},"102-appendix-good-practices/01-general-practices.html":{"url":"102-appendix-good-practices/01-general-practices.html","title":"General Good Practices","keywords":"","body":"General Good Practices\nIn medicine, there are some good practices followed by doctors to heal their patients. Some of them are specific to the discipline. For example, in surgery they use to apply anaesthesia and monitor the patient. There are some other good practices that are non-specific to any discipline. Washing the doctor hands or work in a clean environment are some examples.\nIn software, there are also some general good practices that can be applied to the art of programming. We will discuss some of them along this section.\nDon't Repeat Yourself (DRY)\nWriting the same piece of code in several places is not a good idea. Let's see an example:\nclass AuthService {\n  login(username, password) {\n    let query = this.db.select(\"*\").from(\"users\").where(\"username == \" + username);\n    let rows = this.db.exec(query);\n    if (rows.count == 0) {\n      throw \"user not exists\";\n    }\n    // Do the login\n  }\n\n  changePassword(username, newPassword, oldPassword) {\n    let query = this.db.select(\"*\").from(\"users\").where(\"username == \" + username);\n    let rows = this.db.exec(query);\n    if (rows.count == 0) {\n      throw \"user not exists\";\n    }\n    // Do the password change\n  }\n}\n\nAs we can see, our AuthService class can be used to login users or to change their passwords. But we want to check whether the user exists before proceeding. So we include a pre-condition check in both methods.\nThere are seveeral reasons that makes this particularly not recommended.\n\nWe are making the same work twice. In the best case, we are copying and pasting the lines. But that's also an extra work to be considered.\nThe code is more difficult to read. More lines, and particularly repeated, reduces the focus on the really important things.\nThis is a source of errors. It's fragile. Let's note that we might need to change how the user existence is checked in the code. So we should do it in both methods. We run the risk of changing the code in one place only, leaving the other one as it was. This is a really subtle bug that could be unnoticed for a long time.\n\nSo refactoring the code as follows is recommended.\nclass AuthService {\n  login(username, password) {\n    this.checkUserExists(username);\n    // Do the login\n  }\n\n  changePassword(username, newPassword, oldPassword) {\n    this.checkUserExists(username);\n    // Do the password change\n  }\n\n  checkUserExists(username) {\n    let query = this.db.select(\"*\").from(\"users\").where(\"username == \" + username);\n    let rows = this.db.exec(query);\n    if (rows.count == 0) {\n      throw \"user not exists\";\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nYou Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)\nCode is not for free. It has a cost. A cost to write it, and a cost to maintain it. So the more code you have, the more you are investing on it. As most of us write code to support some business, we expect to have a as much return of investment as possible from it. This has a special implication: each block of code we write has to add value to the software. Otherwise, it should not be written.\nToo often, we write code we think it's useful. Or it will be useful in the future. Typically adding functionality to the application that is not really needed. The return of investment of that is negative. We dedicate time to write and maintain that code when actually is not producing value to the business.\nThe solution: do not write functionality that is not needed. Implement the most functionaly simple thing that could work. But note: this is not a declaration to do the code as fast as possible, implement hacks and forget about clean code, tests, etc. This is about functionality. Do not implement functionality that was not required.\nKeep It Simple Stupid! (KISS)\nEvery piece in a machine is a possible source of failure. Every gear, bearing, switch, button, bulb, can fail by its own. And when they fail, it's really likely that the rest of the machine turns inoperative. Also, many pieces working together require a bigger cognitive load. These systems are more difficult to understand, to learn how they work.\nIt is a maths rule. The more pieces you have in your machine, the more probability of failure. And the more difficulties to understand how the machine work. Software is not an exception. An application comprised by hundred of modules working together is more error prone and hard to understand than one made of a bunch of them.\nThat's why keeping things simple and avoiding unnecessary complexity is a good practice.\nThe Billion Dollar Mistake\nIn 1965, Tony Hoare was working on the design of a new programming language: ALGOL W. This was the first language to incorporate the concept of reference: a type system artifact that make a variable to \"point\" to a value. They designed the language so references could be null, so they point to no value. Since then, almost every programming language that support references accepts null (some call it nil instead).\nIn 2009, Tony Hoare apologised for inventing the null reference during a conference in London. He called that his Billion Dollar Mistake. Null references has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage since invented.\nWhat's wrong with null references? Well, the main problem is that very often we programmers use to make an assumption over references: they are not null. We define a class, define some methods...\nclass ScanService {\n  // ...\n  scan(product, amount) {\n    // ...\n    this.total += product.price * amount;\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\n...and we assume product and amount are never null. But then, somehow, a null value is received in product. Perhaps because it was read from a JSON field that came through a HTTP request. And we didn't check it is null or not while unmarshalling (again: we don't expect that). So we end up executing the equivalent to this.total += null.price * amount. And that fails throwing:\nTypeError: Cannot read property 'price' of null\nThis happens all the time. It's the top 1 of mistakes that make a system crash. Probably the impact in the software industry is much more than 1 billion dollars.\nHow can we deal with this? Well, it's not easy. Unfortunately, most programming languages consider that any variable can be null (everything is a reference, thus everything can be null). That's the case of Javascript, Ruby, Python, Java... . Nevertheless, there are some useful tips that help to mitigate the effects.\nThe first one is to put barries in your code to prevent the entrance of null values in your application. If you receive data from the network, from a file, from a database, make sure it contains no null values. Implement validations there and do not let any null to enter your domains, signalling the error (throw an exception, return HTTP 400 response, etc).\nOnce we have that, we will find we have to admit a variable can be null. For example, the email field of our User data class could be null to indicate we don't have the email for that user. In these cases, it could be convenient to use a placeholder constant that represents that null value. The placeholder is not a null reference, but a reference to an actual value that can behave like a regular one.\nvar NULL_EMAIL = \"Email address was not set\";\n\nclass User {\n  constructor(firstName, lastName) {\n    this.firstName = firstName;\n    this.lastName = lastName;\n    this.email = NULL_EMAIL;\n  }\n}\n\nThanks to that, we will have a defined behavior for any possible value of email field, even when its null. For instance, we can print the User properties without checking if things are null or not, so using our favorite HTML renderer:\nUser information:\n\n  First name: {{ $user.firstName }}\n  Last name: {{ $user.lastName }}\n  Email: {{ $user.email }}\n\n\nWe can also compare email values to check if they are unset when needed. For instance, while sending emails:\nfunction mailing_campaign(users, message) {\n  users.forEach(function (user) {\n    if (user.email != NULL_EMAIL) {\n      send_email(user.email, message);\n    }\n  })\n}\n\nAnother way to solve this is to use an option type. This is a data type present in some languages that can have one of these two states:\n\nSome(x), where x is the value it wraps. It represents a non-null value.\nNone. It represents a null value.\n\nSome examples are the Optional generic class in Java 8 or the Option enum type in Rust.\nThe point is that, when using statically typed languages (read this section for more details), we will interact with the interface of that optional type, forcing the programmer to consider that it can be none.\nclass User {\n  private String firstName;\n  private String lastName;\n  private Optional email;\n\n  public User(String firstName, String lastName) {\n    this.firstName = firstName;\n    this.lastName = lastName;\n    this.email = Optional.empty(); // This is None\n  }\n\n  public Optional getEmail() { return this.email; }\n\n  public void setEmail(String value) {\n    this.email = Optional.of(value); // This is Some(value)\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n\nUser user = new User(\"John\", \"Carpenter\");\nuser.setEmail(\"john.carpenter@example.com\");\n\nOur email property is not String, but Optional. So we have to use it accordingly:\nvoid sendEmail(String address, String message) { ... }\n\nvoid mailingCampaign(List users, String message) {\n  for (User user : users) {\n    // ERROR: getEmail() is not String but Optional\n    // sendEmail(user.getEmail(), message)\n\n    // OK: Optional implements ifPresent(), that will execute the action only when defined\n    user.getEmail().ifPresent(email -> sendEmail(email, message));\n  }\n}\n\n"},"102-appendix-good-practices/02-design-practices.html":{"url":"102-appendix-good-practices/02-design-practices.html","title":"Design Good Practices","keywords":"","body":"Design Good Practices\nAt the beginning, every software project is a masterpiece. Everything is simple, clean, concise, elegant. But then the time passes, and the software start to rot. It's a progressive process: an ugly part here, a little hack there. And over time the rotting continues until our beautiful codebase becomes a mess that the developers find increasingly hard to maintain. Eventually, the effort required to make the simplest of changes to the software becomes so high that the engineers cry for a full rewrite (likely using microservices :-) ).\nSymptoms of rotten software\nBut, how do we detect our codebase is rotting? There are four symptoms that could help to detect it.\n\nRigidity. The tendency of the software to be difficult to change. Every single change causes a cascade of changes in other parts of the code (dependencies). What seemed to be a two days change becomes several weeks of work. This derives in unhappy managers, who in degenerate cases reduce the changes to critical fixes only. The software stops adding new value to the business. And the product collapses.\n\nFragility. The tendency of the software to break upon changes. Very often, changes that have nothing to do with the part that brokes. Managers are afraid to make changes, so they limit them as they do before rigidity. Again, in degenerated cases we stop adding new value, and the product collapses.\n\nImmobility. The inability to reuse software fragments. When one programmer detects he needs a module that is similar to one that other programmer wrote. However, the module to be reused is tangled with its dependencies, and the cost of separating things is too great. And the module is simply rewritten.\n\nViscosity. The tendency of the software to make it difficult to preserve the design, stimulating the programmer to make hacks instead. In other words, it's easy to do the wrong thing, but hard to do the right thing. This is something that applies not only to the code but also to the development environment: build systems, testing frameworks, service configuration, etc.\n\n\nCauses of rotten software\nThere is one simple root cause for our beloved software to degrade: changing requirements. That's essentially why our codebase starts as a clean, elegant solution. Not only because it is small, but also because we start defining our architecture based on clear requirements. So we make a design that does the job really well. But, the sooner or later the requirements will change. And the software will have to give response to things it was not designed for.\nWe cannot expect the requirements not to change. This is a essential part of software development. What we have to do is to find a way to make our designs resilient to changes. But, what kind of changes could degrade our designs so much? Simple: those that introduce new and unplanned dependencies. Each of the four symptoms described above is either directly or indirectly caused by improper dependencies between the modules of our software. We have to manage the dependencies to prevent they propagate. We need dependency firewalls.\nSOLID Principles\nThere are five well-known principles in Object Oriented Programming (but most of them applicable to other programming paradigms) that could be followed in order to manage module dependencies. We will analyze them in detail in the reminder of this appendix.\nS: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)\nEach software module should have one and only one reason to change.\nThis is another formulation of the principles of cohesion and coupling: gather together the things that change for the same reasons. Separate those things that change for different reasons. That's exactly the meaning of one reason to change. If there are more than one business logic coded in a module, we will have more than one single person (or business unit) requesting changes in that module. As consequence, the changes requested by one person could impact the business logic under the responsibility of another one: introducing new bugs, changing the behavior unexpectedly, affecting the performance, etc.\nLet's see an example. Consider a module that generates and prints a finantial report. If we think about it, we could distinguish two different reasons to change, as:\n\nChange what are the contents of the report. We might want to add a new item that tells how much we invested in floppy disks in the last month.\nChange how this report is printed. We might want to generate a PDF output instead of the HTML one we had so far.\n\nThe SRP says that these two aspects of the problem are really two separate responsibilities, and should therefore be in separate modules.\nO: Open Closed Principle (OCP)\nA module should be open for extension but closed for modification.\nIt means simply this: we should write our modules so that they can be extended, without requiring them to be modified. In other words, we want to be able to change what the modules do, without changing the source code of the modules.\nAn essential way to achieve this is creating abstractions. In Object Oriented Programming, we can define abstract classes or interfaces that define the contract of the module. The code that depends in such module will depend in these abstract classes or interfaces, and not in the implementations. If we need to extend the module, it's as simple as adding new classes that implements the abstract class or interface to the module. That requires no change in any existing code. Neither in our module, neither in others that depends on it.\n\nIf you are not familiar with terms like interace of abstract class, you can read this introduction to polymorphism and abstract types.\n\nLet's see this with an example. Let's assume we have a web application that have to authenticate an HTTP request to ensure it contains a valid username and password. We put all the code that does the authentication in a function authorize(user, password) that, given a user and a password, indicates whether that user is authenticated. Internally, this funcion queries the DB to look for that user and check if the password matches.\nThis design is not following OCP. If we want to add a new way to authenticate users (e.g., LDAP, OAuth, etc), we will have to change most of the code in the authorize function. A nice way to follow OCP would be to define a AuthenticationProvider abstract class.\n\ngraph TD\n  AP[\"Â«interfaceÂ»AuthenticationProvider----------------------------------+ authorize(user, password)\"]\n\n  RequestHandler --> AP\n  AP-. implements .-DbAuthenticationProvider\n  AP-. implements .-LdapAuthenticationProvider\n  AP-. implements .-OauthAuthenticationProvider\n  AP-. implements .-More[...]\n\n  style LdapAuthenticationProvider fill:#afa;\n  style OauthAuthenticationProvider fill:#afa;\n  style More fill:#afa;\n\n\nThis provides an abstract method authorize(user, password).  Our request handlers would have access to an instance of AuthenticationProvider, so they only have to invoke authorize and forget about the details of how it is implemented. Initially, we would provide a DbAuthenticationProvider class that implements the interface defined by AuthenticationProvider. If we want to add more authentication methods, we would add new classes to the design: LdapAuthenticationProvider, OAuthAuthenticationProvider, etc, without changing a single line of code in auth module.\nL: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)\nSubclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.\nThe concept is simple. Derived classes should be substitutable for their base classes. That is, a user of a base class should continue to\nfunction properly if a derivative of that base class is passed to it. This may seem obvious, but there are subtleties that need to be considered. The canonical example is the Circle/Ellipse dilemma.\nMost of us learn, in high school math, that a circle is just a degenerate form of an ellipse. All circles are ellipses with coincident foci. So we can have a definition of ellipse as:\nclass Ellipse {\n  constructor(focusA, focusB, radius) {\n    this.focusA = focusA;\n    this.focusB = focusB;\n    this.radius = radius;\n  }\n\n  get focusA() { return this.focusA; }\n  get focusB() { return this.focusB; }\n  get radius() { return this.radius; }\n\n  set focusA(val) { this.focusA = val; }\n  set focusB(val) { this.focusB = val; }\n  set radius(val) { this.radius = val; }\n\n  area() {\n    return ...;\n  }\n}\n\nA ellipse is a pair of foci points and a radius. We provide some getters and setters, and a method to calculat its area from the properties. Now, we can define the circle as:\nclass Circle extends Ellipse {\n  constructor(center, radius) {\n    super(center, center, radius);\n  }\n\n  set focusA(val) {\n    this.focusA = val;\n    this.focusB = val;\n  }\n  set focusB(val) {\n    this.focusA = val;\n    this.focusB = val;\n  }\n}\n\nWhat we do here is to request just the center of the circle and the radius in the constructor. In other words, the single focus point we will have. We pass it from the constructor as both focusA and focusB constructor arguments, so both foci are the same. We also override some methods to satisfy both foci are always the same.\nPerfect! We did it. We have a circle definition that reuses the ellipse definition with subtyping. Now let's check whether it satisfies LSP:\nvoid func(ellipse) {\n  let a = Point(-1,0);\n  let b = Point(1,0);\n  ellipse.focusA = a\n  ellipse.focusB = b\n  assert(ellipse.focusA == a);\n  assert(ellipse.focusB == b);\n}\n\nIf we invoke func() with an instance of Ellipse class, the code works fine. We set the foci, and check they are still there. But if we invoke it with an instance of Circle, the code doesn't work. The call to the focusB setter also writes focusA property, so ellipse.focusA == a is not met anymore. Even though we defined a subtype relationship between Ellipse and Circle, the instances of the latter cannot be used where instances of the former are expected. We are not fully satisfying the contract. More precisely, the post-conditions of the setters are not met.\nI: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)\nMany client specific interfaces are better than one general purpose interface.\nThe essence of the principle is quite simple. If you have a class that has several clients, rather than loading the class with all the methods that the clients need, create specific interfaces for each client and multiply inherit them into the class.\n\ngraph LR\n  ClientA[Client A] --> Service\n  ClientB[Client B] --> Service\n  ClientC[Client C] --> Service\n\n\nLet's say we have a class with many clients, and one large interface to serve them all. Note that whenever a change is made to one of the methods that one client calls, the rest of clients may be affected.\n\ngraph LR\n  ClientA[Client A] --> ServiceA[\"Â«interfaceÂ»Service A\"]\n  ClientB[Client B] --> ServiceB[\"Â«interfaceÂ»Service B\"]\n  ClientC[Client C] --> ServiceC[\"Â«interfaceÂ»Service C\"]\n\n  ServiceA-. implements .-Service\n  ServiceB-. implements .-Service\n  ServiceC-. implements .-Service\n\n\nA better technique is to have the methods needed by each client placed in special interfaces that are specific to that client. Those interfaces are multiply inherited by the implementing class.\nD: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)\nDepend upon Abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions.\nDependency Inversion is the strategy of depending upon interfaces or abstract functions and classes, rather than upon concrete functions and classes. In fact, we already discussed about this and we saw an example in OCP.\nWe use to make software following a top-down design that exhibits a particular kind of dependency structure. High level modules depend upon lower level modules, which depend upon yet lower level modules, etc. For example, in a web application, the path router depends on the page controllers. The page controllers depend on services. The services depend on repositories. The repositories depend on DB clients. And so on. That's actually the direction of the function calls in runtime.\n\ngraph TD\n  PathRouter --> IndexController\n  PathRouter --> LoginController\n  PathRouter --> ProductController\n\n  IndexController --> other1[...]\n  LoginController --> LoginService\n  LoginController --> AnalyticsService\n  ProductController --> other2[...]\n\n  LoginService --> UsersRepository\n  AnalyticsService --> other3[...]\n  UsersRepository --> MySQLClient\n\n\nThanks to object oriented programming techniques, we can revert the direction of the dependencies by introducing abstract classes or interfaces in the design.\n\ngraph TD\n  PathRouter --> Controller[\"Â«interfaceÂ»Controller\"]\n  IndexController --> other1[...]\n  Controller-. implements .-IndexController\n  Controller-. implements .-LoginController\n  Controller-. implements .-ProductController\n\n  LoginController --> LoginService[\"Â«interfaceÂ»LoginService\"]\n  LoginController --> AnalyticsService[\"Â«interfaceÂ»AnalyticsService\"]\n  LoginService-. implements .-DefaultLoginService\n  AnalyticsService-. implements .-GoogleAnalyticsService\n\n  DefaultLoginService --> UserRepository[\"Â«interfaceÂ»UserRepository\"]\n  UserRepository-. implements .-DbUserRepository\n\n  ProductController --> other2[...]\n  GoogleAnalyticsService --> other3[...]\n\n\nThanks to this, we can see that some modules like LoginController depends exclusively on abstract classes LoginService and AnalyticsService. So any other dependency carried by the implementations is not propagated to LoginController (the dependency firewall we discussed above). In fact, what we did is to invert the dependencies. We might expect LoginController, LoginService and AnalyticsService to be declared in the same module controllers.login. And DefaultLoginService implementation class to be declared in a different one: services.login.\n\ngraph LR\n  subgraph controllers.login\n    LoginController --> LoginService[\"Â«interfaceÂ»LoginService\"]\n    LoginController --> AnalyticsService[\"Â«interfaceÂ»AnalyticsService\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph services.login\n    LoginService-. implements .-DefaultLoginService\n  end\n\n  subgraph services.analytics\n    AnalyticsService-. implements .-GoogleAnalyticsService\n  end\n\n\nNow the module dependencies go in the reverse direction respect the function calls. The implementations depends on the abstract interfaces they implement. That's why this is called dependency inversion.\n"},"102-appendix-good-practices/99-polymorphism-and-abstract-types.html":{"url":"102-appendix-good-practices/99-polymorphism-and-abstract-types.html","title":"Polymorphism and Abstract Types","keywords":"","body":"Polymorphism and Abstract Types\nIf you come with a background in Javascript exclusively, it is very likely that terms like interface or abstract type are totally new to you. Since these terms are massivelly used when talking about good practices in Object Oriented Programming, we will dedicate this section to explain them in detail.\nDynamically vs statically typed languages\nJavascript is a dynamically typed language. It roughtly means that the types of the variables of your program are determined in runtime, when the program is executed. One example in Javascript:\nfunction isEven(num) {\n  return num % 2 === 0;\n}\n\nHere, we expect num to be a number. But we do not indicate so in any way. We expect that, whenever this function is invoked when executed, the runtime will handle any possible type error. In Javascript, most of the situations are handled by doing nothing. In this particular case, passing anything that is not a number as argument will do: strings, objects, nulls... as all them respond to the % operator. So they will provide unexpected results. They will fail silently.\nisEven(1) // false\nisEven(2) // true\nisEven(\"Hello\") // false\nisEven(null) // true\nisEven(new Object) // false\n\nSome other dynamically typed languages are more strict, and will throw an explicit error in this case.\ndef is_even(num)\n  num % 2 == 0\nend\n\nis_even(1) # false\nis_even(2) # true\nis_even(nil) # NoMethodError: undefined method `%' for nil:NilClass\nis_even(new Object) # NoMethodError: undefined method `new' for main:Object\n\nThese are dynamically typed languages. By contrast, some other are statically typed languages. Roughtly speaking, these languages are characterized by requiring the programmer to indicate what's the type of every variable used in his code. One example in Go:\nfunc IsEven(num int) bool {\n    return num % 2 == 0\n}\n\nAs you can see, we have to indicate num is an integer value. We also indicate the result type of IsEven() function is a boolean. But, how is this information used? Simple. These languages have a compilation step prior to the execution of the program. While compiling, the source code is processed by a tool (the compiler) that will convert it in a \"executable\" program. In this conversion process, the program is also checked to be valid. And one of the validations the compiler do is a type check. It ensures IsEven(), and any other function, is not invoked with values of wrong data types. So this fragment of code would be accepted by the compiler:\n  fmt.Println(IsEven(1)) // false\n  fmt.Println(IsEven(2)) // true\n\nWhile this other will not:\n  fmt.Println(IsEven(\"Hello\")) // compilation error: cannot use \"Hello\" (type string) as type int in argument to IsEven\n\nDynamically and statically typed languages implement abstractions in a different way. Thus, it's important to understand the difference before further discussion.\nPolymorphism\nThis is a key concept related to abstractions in Object Oriented Programming. Polymorphism is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types. In other words, to define a contract of what we can obtain from an object (the interface) that is safisfied by different data types. Doing that we can write code that depends exclusively on the interface (what it does) and not in the implementation (how it does).\nPolymorphism is implemented in a completely different way depending on the language is dynamically or statically typed. In dynamically typed languages, it is obtained via Duck Typing. Since type checks are done in runtime, the object is checked to implement a method call (implement the expected interface) when the program is executed. Some example in Javascript:\nclass Cat {\n  talk() {\n    return \"Meow!\";\n  }\n}\n\nclass Dog {\n  talk() {\n    return \"Woof!\";\n  }\n}\n\nfunction f(animal) {\n  console.log(\"The animal says: \", animal.talk());\n}\n\nPlease note both classes, Cat and Dog, implement a talk() method. There is a really important implication here: both classes implement the same interface: an object that can respond to calls to talk(). We didn't specified the existence of such a interface in the code. But a kind of Animal interface is there, implicitely, in the code. This is essentially the Duck Typing: If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck. In other words, if we find in runtime a value that has the structure required by the interface, it works. In our example we could talk about animal typing. But... you get the idea.\nIn contrast, statically typed languages require that every type is specified before compilation. So in languages like Java we will use another technique: subtyping polymorphism.\ninterface Animal {\n    abstract String talk();\n}\n\nclass Cat implements Animal {\n    String talk() {\n        return \"Meow!\";\n    }\n}\n\nclass Dog implements Animal {\n    String talk() {\n        return \"Woof!\";\n    }\n}\n\nvoid f(Animal a) {\n  println(a.talk());\n}\n\nIn this case, he had to declare the interface Animal explictly. We also indicated explicitely that both Cat and Dog implement the interface of Animal. And then we can define function f() to accept any value that implements the interface.\nAbstractions\nWhile talking about Object Oriented Design and good practices associated to it, we will mention things like interface, abstract class, implementation, etc. We are actually talking about using the polymorphism techniques available in our programming language to define interfaces for different types. And we will depict the things using diagrams like this one:\n\ngraph TD\n  Animal-. implements .- Cat\n  Animal-. implements .- Dog\n\n\nSo that's all about abstractions. Define interfaces, explicitely or not, that we can use in other parts of the code to abstract them from the actual implementations and separate the concerns.\n"}}}
